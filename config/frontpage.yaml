  This frontpage is made by scraping arxiv and by runnig a spaCy model that detects 
  if the abstract describes a paper about a new specific topic. Right now we try to
  find interesting articles about new dataset or about prompt engineering. Many datasets 
  will be about NLP, but typically this also has some computer vision, humanities and physics 
  datasets in the mix too.
