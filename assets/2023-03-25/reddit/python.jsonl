{"title":"My first app in Tkinter - B\u00e9zier curve read off","description":"Hello, I started coding in Python about 5 months ago. I worked mainly with Pygame, but now, I have shifted my interest to Tkinter.  \nFor my first application with this module, I chose to do B\u00e9zier curve read off. If you have an image with a quadratic or cubic B\u00e9zier curve and do not know the correct equations, this application can help you with that. You only need to import the image and shape the B\u00e9zier curve in the app to look like the one in the image, the application can then provide you with the corresponding equations. In addition, it also tells you where the extrema of the curve are and highlights them for you.\n\nIn the future, I plan to add the ability to add more than one B\u00e9zier curve.\n\nI also made a Youtube video where I go into a little bit more detail:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN47iyTLCG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN47iyTLCG8)\n\nI would like to hear your opinion and what I could improve.\n\nYou can find the code here:  \n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-iKEmiFGzq0-Gq76yNXk5jrb2IK3BUEX/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-iKEmiFGzq0-Gq76yNXk5jrb2IK3BUEX/view?usp=sharing)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/121h43w/my_first_app_in_tkinter_b\u00e9zier_curve_read_off/","created":"2023-03-25","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":1}}
{"title":"Input on designing an introduction to python course","description":"Hi!\n\nI am designing a mandatory Python-based introductory programming course for \\*all\\* engineering students at my university (software engineering to medico technology!). \n\nThe course will be placed in their first semester and correspond to 1/6th of their overall workload in that semester (5ECTS/13 teaching sessions/2h teaching+2h lab). It will run in parallel to the math-course, which has examples typeset in notebooks using numpy/sympy (but from a user perspective).\n\nFor some of the technical lines (AI, robotics, etc.) this will unfortunately be their only mandatory programming course, which mean it has to do a great deal for a lot of different students. Because of these demands, I would ideally like it to start from the absolute basics (\\*no\\* prior programming experience) and end up with basic OOP as this will be important for those who do AI later (sklearn, torch, etc.), with a minimum of deviations along the way. The course will be open source  (i.e. hosted on gitlab pages; all material available without login).\n\nI have looked for other courses for inspiration, but many other courses include additional things (CS50 from Harvard) or seem to assume to much prior knowledge: [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/) \n\nThe kind of course I am aiming for (obviously this is open to criticism) is one that focuses maximally on the language (primitive datatypes, functions, lists+other compound types, loops, basic oop, basics about packages), somewhat focuses on useful developer skills (what is an interpreter, how to debug code, etc.) and very minimally on everything else (no regexp, no big libraries like pandas, only basic file reading/writing, etc.).  The lab sessions will be based on editing/writing .py files in VSCode.\n\nI am hoping that some here can recommend good resources -- Ideally an open-source course which has a similar scope and a really good progression curve, or a good (concise!) book, etc. Any general advice is of course welcome, but I feel stumped by the whole 'what fit in which weeks and how much' side of things. My current outline is:\n\n1. intro, print, simple functions, algebraic operations: Basically a very few examples of python to talk over that 'we will get to'. Must assume many don't have python working yet.\n\n2. primitive types, conversions int('31'), basic functions (analogy with math). \n\n3. functions++, variables, if/else. Mention type annotation to avoid confusion.\n\n4. Reading/writing text files as 'copy paste code', string operations. String manipulation is formatted as a soft intro to lists.\n\n5. Lists, loops, tuples, functions of multiple variables. \"adfsa\".split(), \"\".join(..), etc.\n\n6. Sets, functions of mutiple output arguments, comprehension, range(), enumerate()\n\n7. dicts, more on comprehension and looping, items()\n\n8. exceptions, asesrt, packages (all just a very brief overview). This is a catch-up lecture\n\n9. classes 1 (classes, mutability)\n\n10. classes 2 (inheritance, \\_\\_add\\_\\_, etc.)\n\n11. build your own sympy 1: running example on building an alternative sympy\n\n12. build your own sympy 2: running example on building a sympy + catch-up","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/121gujc/input_on_designing_an_introduction_to_python/","created":"2023-03-25","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":1}}
{"title":"myKamus: A Free and Open Source Indonesian Translation Program","description":"G'day all!\n\nToday I am here to showcase my first public open source program (which is VERY simple but very useful or anyone like me)!\n\nIf you try to clone it, take note that one of the files is over 700mb so it is stored on the GitHub large file service.\n\nDescription:\n\n*myKamus is An open source instant translation software for Indonesian that provides the user with complex Indonesian-English translation capabilities. To run the program you can either do it from inside an IDE of your choice, or with Python installed either:*\n\n*a) Run clipboard\\_monitor through IDLE*\n\n*b) Launch a Powershell session through the directory and run clipboard\\_monitor through it*\n\n*It utilises several open source bitext corpus to provide access to over 50 million example sentences and words for the purposes of translation. The program is free to use for academic and non-commercial applications, if you wish to use it for something else email me at* [*gabrielcbarnett@gmail.com*](mailto:gabrielcbarnett@gmail.com)*. There will be no cost involved for a license to use in a corporate, government or military environment, it is so we can discuss any needs you might have for updates, specific vocabulary or language requirements. Again, it will be free but a representative from your organization must make contact with me first.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*If you like this program and have found it useful for your work, feel free to email with your success story or anyimprovements that you might suggest.*\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Automatically translate individual words and phrases from the computers clipboard which it monitors through the use of pyperclip\n* The library of approximately 60 million sentences and words means the nine times out of ten you will find either the definition of the word that you are looking for or an example sentence that you will be able to infer the meaning of the word from.\n* This means you are likely to find almost all verb/noun forms that Indonesian has to offer\n* Excellent for people who have learnt Indonesian through school or work and just need to look the odd word up quickly without using a translation service like Google or Deepl (which often provide misleading results anyway).\n\nA link to the program can be found here:\n\n[https://github.com/GabrielBarnett/myKamus](https://github.com/GabrielBarnett/myKamus)\n\nI am happy to take suggestions on how to improve the program, but I have only been working on the for a few hours now. At some point I would like to build it into a GUI and use pyInstaller to actually make an executable for the program, but I can't work out how to use pyInstaller on a project with multiple py files and have it also include the dependent translation files which at over 700mg in size.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1219gse/mykamus_a_free_and_open_source_indonesian/","created":"2023-03-25","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}

To be more precise: it was about so called dust detectors, like the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) that was on-board the NASA's probe Cassini.\n\nBut conducting calibration experiments and recording and storing tons of data is one thing. The next logical step: deriving actual calibration functions!\n\nFor this part I created a small tutorial that shows the already existing functions to compute the velocity of dust impacts, based on some electric signals. *Why is the velocity so important?* Well, based on the impact speed and direction of the instrument at the \"moment\" of impact, one can derive astro-dynamical insights.\n\nAnd later ... when we take a look at the science part ... you will see that ... well I don't want to spoil ... you can create amazing science results with these \"simple\" computations!\n\nAnyway, further I compute the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RSME) to obtain some performance result of the calibration functions. *Why?* Well next week we will use a **Tensorflow / Keras** based approach to create a **Machine Learning based calibration function**. The MAEs and RSME are the \"benchmark\" values we need to \"beat\".\n\nStay tuned,\n\nThomas\n\nVideo: [https://youtu.be/RkVx-7fcVRY](https://youtu.be/RkVx-7fcVRY)\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/%5BProject%5D-Cassini-CDA/01-Calibration/02\\_prior\\_calibration.ipynb](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/blob/main/%5BProject%5D-Cassini-CDA/01-Calibration/02_prior_calibration.ipynb)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/120zfin/nasas_cassini_cosmic_dust_analyzer_a_proper/","created":"2023-03-24","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}
