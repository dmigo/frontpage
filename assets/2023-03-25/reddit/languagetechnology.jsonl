{"title":"(Soon) NLP graduate and feel completely inferior on the job market","description":"I am a master student in NLP/Computational linguistics and currently looking for jobs after graduation. Prepare for long panicked post, hope this is the right place to ask/vent..\n\nBoth my bachelor and master were a specialized NLP degree. Especially the bachelor was pretty general: I took all the same intro to linguistics (syntax, phonetics, morphology etc.) classes as the theoretical linguistics. I had a lot of \u201etraditional\u201c NLP methods such as parsing based on formal languages, automata theory, search algorithms. Basic maths, statistics, linear algebra. Specialized seminars on coreference, sentiment analysis etc but those were mostly in the style of reading-papers-and-discussing-them. My master offered more technical and applied courses, but I did not feel well prepared since I never learned how to program neural networks myself except for a very basic numpy and pandas based classifier, but suddenly everyone was talking about transformer models. I had theoretical ML classes, but somehow we were just expected to know how to implement them into our projects too? I am now doing my thesis where I am using an existing system (pytorch-based) and adapting and tuning it for a slightly different task. While I (thought I) know how to program and the basic of how machine learning, the reality is I feel soooo out of place. I have a hard time even understanding the pytorch documentation, and I feel like there are a million things to consider. Shapes don\u2019t match, cuda out of memory, suddenly i need to do gradient clipping which I feel I was taught about in 30min 2 years ago maybe. I usually make it work somehow after 5 nervous breakdows, but I constantly feel like I am half-assing everything, just trying to get it to run at least. If I were to build such a system, even a way simple one, from scratch, I would die.\n\nNow looking at jobs, most of those that advertise with NLP require \u201epractical machine learning experience with frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch\u2026\u201c, and nearly every job is also equally directed at graduates from EITHER data science, mathematics, computer science, NLP \u2026 How can I keep up with data scientists in this aspect? Did I mess up by not practicing how to actually code and understand complex systems during my degree? I know a few other students who expressed similar concerns, at least from my school. I definitely see potential for me in areas with highly specialized use cases/messy/non-standard data, but wonder if this really needed &gt;3 years of linguistic basics. Will employers actually care about my linguistic background compared to a data scientist with some NLP experience? Currently I feel like I would have done better doing a data science degree and then taking a few classes on linguistics later on to specialize\u2026. I guess I will find a job one way or another but I am already scared of interviews because of these inadequacies.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11zvsnj/soon_nlp_graduate_and_feel_completely_inferior_on/","created":"2023-03-23","tags":["ml","languagetechnology","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":14}}
{"title":"SUMMARY OF LANGUAGE LEARNING APPS USING GPT","description":" Notion, Bing and Microsoft Office have integrated GPT. Now it's time for Duolingo and other language learning apps to catch up with this trend, providing a native communication training environment and helping you practice 24/7! \n\nIn order for us not to be behind with this trend, I have summarized some language learning applications with GPT integration: Duolingo Max, Speak and eJOY EPIC.\n\n**1. DUOLINGO:**\n\na. Features of GPT - Duolingo Max integration:\n\n\\- Roleplay: Voice chat with AI for multiple communication contexts: order drinks at the cafe, plan outings, go shopping\u2026 with Duolingo characters\n\n\\- Explain My Answer: give examples and explanations for your answers in the lesson whether you choose right or wrong\n\nb. Advantage:\n\n\\- User-friendly interface, easy to use\n\n\\- Automatically show suggestions for better communication next time after each dialogue\n\n\\- Automatically analyze answers\n\n\\- Roleplay option gives +40 XP, much higher than normal lessons (+10 XP)\n\nc. Defect:\n\n\\- Currently Duolingo Max is only available in the U.S., Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\n\n\\- The only courses that can utilize these new features are Spanish and French for English speakers on iOS\n\n\\- Charges quite high: $29.99/month or $167.99/year\n\n*Link to download Duolingo on iOS:* [*https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-language-lessons/id570060128*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duolingo-language-lessons/id570060128) \n\n*Link to download Duolingo on Android:* [*https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US) \n\n\u2014--\u2014--\u2014--\u2014--\u2014--\n\n**2. SPEAK:**\n\na. GPT integration features:\n\n\\- Role-playing: Chat, voice chat with AI in many communication contexts and goals\n\nb. Advantage:\n\n\\- Friendly interface, easy to use, smooth experience\n\n\\- Classification of communication contexts according to learning level\n\n\\- In each context, there will be examples of sentences and communication goals\n\n\\- There is grading based on intonation and communication goals. The speech recognition of this app is accurate!\n\n\\- Show hints if you don\u2019t know what to say next\n\nc. Defect:\n\n\\- Do not automatically interpret the answer\n\n\\- Only displayed in Japanese and Korean for English learners. Fortunately, I know a few Korean words, but I'm tired of translating the words from Korean\n\n\\- Charge quite high but cheaper than Duolingo: $26.52/month or $117.7/year\n\n*Link to download Speak on iOS:* [*https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/speak-learn-english/id1286609883*](https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/speak-learn-english/id1286609883) \n\n*Link to download Speak on Android:* [*https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.selabs.speak&amp;hl=en*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.selabs.speak&amp;hl=en) \n\n\u2014--\u2014--\u2014--\u2014--\u2014--\n\n**3. eJOY EPIC:**\n\na. GPT Integration Features\n\n\\- Role playing talking with commands and context available\n\n\\- Voice chat with GPT\n\n\\- Look up and save words right in sentences, play games to remember words\n\nb. Advantage:\n\n\\- It's Vietnamese. I'm a bit biased towards Vietnamese products since I\u2019m also one of them \ud83d\ude00\n\n\\- Look up words right in the sentence, save the time to open the dictionary\n\n\\- ChatGPT feature is free to use, but the main features like the course are paid. Free ChatGPT only. But this course is very interesting. I will share more below\n\nc. Defect:\n\n\\- GPT is not integrated into the course section - which is the part I like the most of Epic. Epic's learning concept is also very different from other applications, like having a teacher show you any special vocabulary or grammar in this video, then give exercises for those phrases. Learning experience is quite enjoyable for beginners\n\n\\- Do not automatically interpret the answer\n\n\\- Only suggest prompt for the first question, you have to come up with the content to say and maintain the conversation after that\n\n*Link to download eJOY EPIC on iOS:* [*https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/ejoy-epic-english-courses/id1622797145*](https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/ejoy-epic-english-courses/id1622797145) \n\n*Link to download eJOY EPIC on Android:* [*https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ejoy.epic&amp;hl=en*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ejoy.epic&amp;hl=en)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/120fvgu/summary_of_language_learning_apps_using_gpt/","created":"2023-03-24","tags":["ml","languagetechnology","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}
