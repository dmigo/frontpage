{"title":"Do we really need 100B+ parameters in a large language model?","description":"DataBricks's open-source LLM, [Dolly](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/03/24/hello-dolly-democratizing-magic-chatgpt-open-models.html) performs reasonably well on many instruction-based tasks while being \\~25x smaller than GPT-3, challenging the notion that is big always better?\n\nFrom my personal experience, the quality of the model depends a lot on the fine-tuning data as opposed to just the sheer size. If you choose your retraining data correctly, you can fine-tune your smaller model to perform better than the state-of-the-art GPT-X. The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?\n\nWould love to hear everyone's opinions on how they see the future of LLMs evolving? Will it be few players (OpenAI) cracking the AGI and conquering the whole world or a lot of smaller open-source models which ML engineers fine-tune for their use-cases?\n\nP.S. I am kinda betting on the latter and building [UpTrain](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain), an open-source project which helps you collect that high quality fine-tuning dataset","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/121agx4/do_we_really_need_100b_parameters_in_a_large/","created":"2023-03-25","tags":["reddit","deeplearning","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":11}}

The project leverages the power of machine learning fundamentals to create an accurate model (validation accuracy of 85%), which has been extensively tested using PostMan-API to confirm its efficacy. The model has been deployed using a serverless architecture, which includes AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, IAM, and CloudWatch. The model's endpoint is currently not active to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. To use the model, you will need to deploy it yourself (instructions will be provided below soon).","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/12035gm/i_deployed_a_deeplearning_model_as_a_restapi_to/","created":"2023-03-24","tags":["reddit","deeplearning","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":2}}

{"title":"LTSM to improve autonomous navigation","description":"I'm using DRL to train a model that allows a mobile robot to navigate its environment autonomously (without using a map).\n\nIn the DRL's model, the neural network is completely feedforward. Nothing fancy, just basic layers above layers and the performance is good. It is even good in the case of dynamic obstacles but in the same time, dynamic obstacles are usually humans that already navigate well but when two robots running the same model, a weird behavior happens and a collision is not out of the question. \n\nAnother problem I'm facing is the fact that sometimes the robot stucks at a local optimum, depending on the reward function I'm using.\n\nI've been reading around that having LTSM layers can improve the behavior by 'adding memory'. That memory should make it recognize a local from a global optimum and make it behave better if a dynamic obstacle is around its local proximity. But why? I'm not an expert in DL and all the articles on LTSM seems blunt and mathematical. \n\nCan somebody explain the core idea of LTSMs in an easy way?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/120fbfl/ltsm_to_improve_autonomous_navigation/","created":"2023-03-24","tags":["reddit","deeplearning","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":2}}
