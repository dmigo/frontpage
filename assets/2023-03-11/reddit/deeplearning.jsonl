Many small scripts are very useful but might never be published because of the work that is required to document and explain it.

{"title":"One Shot Learning Task","description":"From my understanding, a one shot learning task requires us that given a query example, we must classify it correctly out of N different classes (typically N = 5 way or 20 way). The goal however is that we are provided with only one example per class.\n\nSuppose we take an MNIST type dataset. I can map every pixel that makes up the digit onto a cartesian plane where the xy coordinates values is every \"pixel\". Using this cartesian representation, can I just find the simple distance metric between the pairs? For example on a 20 way task, My question is: At each iteration, we are provided with some query example, along with 20 other candidates...if we compute some sort of simple similarity score (that doesnt require neural nets) like (intersection over union) between each candidate to query pair, does this still count as a one shot learning task?\n\nSo leaving aside a neural network approach, if we were to just use a simple distance metric on the coordinates to compute the pairwise similarity between the query and every \"candidate\", does this count as one shot learning?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/11o9ilf/one_shot_learning_task/","created":"2023-03-11","tags":["deeplearning","ml","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}
