We're the Swiss Army knife of generative and analytical AI.\n\nRecently, we\u2019ve  released a new update called \"ECF texting experience\" that allows users to literally text the AI, and receive generated content based on what you text. The ECF texting experience can be accessed by going to the generate tab. Our analytical services can be accessed by going to the analyze screen.\n\nWe'd love to have people try the app out, right now we have around 2,000 downloads and we'd like to expand our user base, get feedback, and keep in touch with all of you. We are INCREDIBLY responsive to user feedback at this stage, so recommend to us anything you'd like to see in the future.\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/bright-eye/id1593932475","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptDesign/comments/11t79q1/gpt4_powered_weve_created_a_mobile_ios_ai_app/","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["reddit","promptdesign","prompteng"],"meta":{"num_comments":2}}
