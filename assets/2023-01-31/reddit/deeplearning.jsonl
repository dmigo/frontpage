{"title":"deepmind's ai vision","description":"hey i've been looking at this paper from deepmind [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01281.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01281.pdf) where they train agents to play capture the flag based off of only visual input. what i'm curious about is are there any tricks going on here? Is the ai looking at a \"screen\" the same way a human would and then encodes it's observations after? or is it just looking at a grid of numbers?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/10pwpcu/deepminds_ai_vision/","created":"2023-01-31","tags":["ml","deeplearning","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}
{"title":"Best practice for capping a softmax","description":"I'd like to train a neural network where the softmax output has a minimum possible probability. During training, none of the probabilities should go below this minimum. Basically I want to avoid the logits from becoming too different from each other so that none of the output categories are ever completely excluded in a prediction, a sort of smoothing. What's the best way to do this during training?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/10puvih/best_practice_for_capping_a_softmax/","created":"2023-01-31","tags":["ml","deeplearning","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":12}}
{"title":"Looking for a learning peer...","description":"Hi,\n\nI started the journey of deep learning in about 2 months ago.\n\nWas looking for some peer on learning this beautiful beasty.\n\nI think this kind of learning is more effective than solo learning. This way we define some problems and try to find solutions and ideas for them each other. That's very better I would say than doing these things alone.\n\nWe can do things like, solving problems together, participating in various contests, helping each other to understand things, sharing w/ each other our resources, etc etc.\n\nI'm currently learning based on Hands On ML book chapters.\n\nWanna join me? DM me :)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/10pzh0j/looking_for_a_learning_peer/","created":"2023-01-31","tags":["ml","deeplearning","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}

A lot of models prior to ResNets, such as AlexNet and VGGNet gained from using dropout.\n\nWhy did the authors choose not to use dropout for ResNets ? Is it because they use L2 regularization(weight decay) and batch normalization which are forms of regularization which can substitute dropout regularization ?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/10ol7g6/why_did_the_original_resnet_paper_not_use_dropout/","created":"2023-01-29","tags":["ml","deeplearning","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":7}}
{"title":"If anyone know answer of my question, please tell me","description":"so, I have been learning what DL is and how NN learns to do stuff. From what I understand is the repeated iteration will take random weights and at some point those weights will be kinda perfect for the given task (plz correct me if i'm wrong)\n\nOk, so lets take an example of a task like path finding AI, so we make a NN and train it to go from point A to point B, now it is trained and doing nice and goes to point b perfectly, SO here the weights are set to go from point A to point B right?\n\nWhat if we give the point B somewhere else, How will the AI get perfect weights as the current weights are only perfect for current point B\n\nWhat if we put an obstacle in between point A and B, how will the NN set weights, or is it something like a range of weights which are perfect for any given task for NN\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIDK if I explained it right, plz comment if you have question about my question, and answer also\ud83d\udc95","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/10ohqyw/if_anyone_know_answer_of_my_question_please_tell/","created":"2023-01-29","tags":["ml","deeplearning","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":6}}
