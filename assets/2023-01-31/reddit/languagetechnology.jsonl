{"title":"Is there a database of words grouped by their class/category?","description":"Forgive me, I'm new to this field and don't know how to say it precisely, but I'm looking for a database in which you can lookup a word and get sets related words based on specific functional categories. For example:\n\n- searching \"east\" would return a category of \"cardinal directions\" and the related words \"north\", \"south\", \"west\"\n- searching \"now\" would return \"temporal proximity\" which might have \"soon\", \"later\", \"never\", etc.\n\nI've tried various thesauruses but they only give words of either similar or opposite meaning. They won't give you \"north\" if you search \"east\". Does such a database exist?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/10pr8n1/is_there_a_database_of_words_grouped_by_their/","created":"2023-01-31","tags":["languagetechnology","reddit","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":4}}
{"title":"How to determine how many layers of a transformer model to freeze when fine-tuning?","description":"I frequently read about how people freeze e.g,. all layers except for the 2 top layers when fine-tuning a pretrained model on a downstream task.

{"title":"MusicLM Text to Music AI Google Research","description":"MusicLM is a model generating high-fidelity music from text descriptions such as\u00a0\"a calming violin melody backed by a distorted guitar riff\". MusicLM casts the process of conditional music generation as a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence modeling task, and it generates music at 24 kHz that remains consistent over several minutes. MusicLM can be conditioned on both text and a melody in that it can transform whistled and hummed melodies according to the style described in a text caption.\n\nIn this short video i explain the model behind MusicLM.

{"title":"Need help with hierarchical classification","description":"Hello there! \nLet\u2019s say I have texts (avg word count = 50) and I have to classify them into three levels of labels with 10 labels on each level (1000 classes in total). I\u2019ve found a few solutions: \n1) label-tree can be represented as label-chains so that  it\u2019s simply becomes 1000 different classes and you just build one classifier. \n2) build classifier for each node and make pipeline to get all level labels\n\nFirst approach is not solution for me because I have huge disbalance issue with my classes. Moreover, classes may overlap (one text may belong to several classes).\nI have built classifier according to the second approach and it works fine, but I still have some problems with class overlapping. \n\nHow to build a multi label hierarchical classifier? if I continue to create the classifier system according to the second approach, the system will become very complex. Is there an easier way to solve that problem?\n\nAnother question I have - what label tool should I use for hierarchical classification? I couldn't find such a tool that supports nested lists.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/10p4yrq/need_help_with_hierarchical_classification/","created":"2023-01-30","tags":["languagetechnology","reddit","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}

{"title":"ML developments in measuring text readability and text summarization","description":"I'm curious whether there are any significant developments in measuring text readability using ML, e.g. transformers.

Are there ML models that consistently provide improvement over existing measures? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSimilarly, I'm curious about text summarization, which probably is more ML reliant. I get two texts (each contains 1000 words). I want to summarize them without losing content, not to a certain level (both summaries of 500 words). So one summary might be 400 words long, another 800 words long.
