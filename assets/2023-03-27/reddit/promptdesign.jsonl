{"title":"Advice on replacing OpenAI's davinci-003 with gpt-3.5-turbo","description":"Hi everyone, I am tying to integrate gpt-3.5-turbo for my vim plugin to generate/complete text ([https://github.com/madox2/vim-ai](https://github.com/madox2/vim-ai) ).\n\nCurrently it uses text-davinci-003 and it works just fine. However gpt-3.5-turbo is cheaper and I assume chat models will be more powerful in the future, so I am exploring the ways how to use it.\n\nThe problem is that while davinci generates plain concise text/code, gpt-3.5 always put some human conversation in it (like introducing a solution, summarizing it etc.).\n\nI have played around with a system prompt, I have tried to lower the temperature, but it doesn't help. Do you know any parameters or techniques I should employ to get just plain data out of the model?\n\nI am attaching a picture with a prompt to demonstrate what I am trying to accomplish:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gjov5mrdy2qa1.png?width=844&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b5213930c689a0e587b4a3a4724571428c47bbdb","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptDesign/comments/122l3xl/advice_on_replacing_openais_davinci003_with/","created":"2023-03-26","tags":["reddit","promptdesign","prompteng"],"meta":{"num_comments":8}}

{"title":"Looking for other informative subreddits, websites, blogs, YouTube-channels, Twitter-accounts, wiki's and newsletters to RSS Feed on the topics discussed here on r/PromptDesign","description":"Hi, In my attempts to digest as much valuable information about topics posted and being discussed here at r/PromptDesign, I am reorganizing my RSS Feed to create a daily routine of consuming info (overload.) The time is now. Especially with how fast AI developments follow up on each other. \n\nFeedly has been my RSS Feed app since december 2014 and I cannot live without it anymore. (Although I am always looking out for good alternatives.)\n\nCurrently I am subscribed to the following subreddits: r/PromptDesign/, r/aipromptprogramming, r/MachineLearning/, r/midjourney/, r/OpenAI, r/ChatGPT/, r/Wolfram/\n\nFurthermore I have a subscription to Medium, which has a fair amount of great articles posted about the subject of AI on a daily basis. And I subscribed to YouTube-channels from companies behind the AI-projects (for which I make frequent use of [https://glasp.co/youtube-summary](https://glasp.co/youtube-summary) to create and read summaries made by ChatGPT.)\n\nI am looking for more other informative subreddits, websites, blogs, YouTube-channels, Twitter-accounts, wiki's and newsletters to RSS Feed on the topics discussed here, so if you have any good suggestions, I welcome and appreciate any comment to expand the ever-growing list of sources for more AI-news to distil and digest.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptDesign/comments/121jxbc/looking_for_other_informative_subreddits_websites/","created":"2023-03-25","tags":["reddit","promptdesign","prompteng"],"meta":{"num_comments":2}}
