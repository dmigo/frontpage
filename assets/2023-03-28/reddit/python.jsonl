{"title":"Hikaru 1.0.0 released","description":"Hikaru provides a variety of tooling to work with Kubernetes configs in Python, YAML, or JSON, allowing you to move smoothly between each of these representations, and can also use the Python representation to directly interact with Kubernetes. Hikaru helps you migrate from YAML, easily create watches, detect changes in configuration, create CRDs and their controllers, and more. You can find out more Hikaru here at the PyPI page:\n\n[https://pypi.org/project/hikaru/](https://pypi.org/project/hikaru/)\n\n...at the Github repo:\n\n[https://github.com/haxsaw/hikaru](https://github.com/haxsaw/hikaru)\n\n...or read the full doc at ReadTheDocs:\n\n[https://hikaru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://hikaru.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n\nHikaru 1.0.0 adds support for custom resource definitions. Hikaru now supports:\n\n* The ability to define the structure of a CRD with Hikaru classes, either from scratch or to mimic one that is already in your environment,\n* Sending the defintition into Kubernetes where it will be established as a CRD managed by K8s,\n* Managing instances of the new CRD using CRUD methods,\n* Establishing Watchers on the new CRD to in order to monitor activity or create controllers in Python, and\n* The use of CRD classes as context managers, just like other Hikaru document classes.\n\nThis all works smoothly with the existing Hikaru features. Full documentation for these new features can be found in the \"Advanced Topics\" section of the Hikaru docs.\n\nThis release still contains support for the same set of Kubernetes releases, 23.x through 26.x.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/123sqzs/hikaru_100_released/","created":"2023-03-27","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":20}}

{"title":"Seeking early feedback on MegaMock - a dev experience upgrade to mocking","description":"Hello! I've been working on a project called [MegaMock](https://github.com/JamesHutchison/megamock) that upgrades the developer experience when working with mocks! Some of the key features:\n\n* You pass in objects and functions, not strings, so IDE tools like \"rename\", \"go to definition\", \"find references\", etc will work seamlessly\n* When you pass in an object as a spec, it's automatically auto-speced.\n* When you use patch, all locations are patched, so you don't need to worry about how the object was imported in the module that uses the thing in question.\n* The generated types are a union of the mock and the type, so auto-complete is available via the IDE\n* If you mock out a class entirely, you can restore the real logic for certain methods, as demonstrated in the image below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/wpit0m2xddqa1.gif\n\nDespite working on this for a while, I know there are still gaps in functionality, but I'm putting this out here to get an idea if things are moving in the right direction.

This is useful for generating more coherent and on-topic responses based on your tags.\n\n\ud83d\udce6 **PyPI Deployment**: gptty is now available on PyPI, making it super easy to install and get started with just a simple `pip install gptty`.\n\n**Why should developers choose gptty?**\n\n\ud83c\udfaf **Focus on Delivered Value**: gptty is designed to help developers, data scientists, and anyone interested in leveraging ChatGPT to get the most value out of the API, thanks to context preservation, command-line integration, and new query feature.\n\n\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Ease of Use &amp; Flexibility**: gptty offers an intuitive command-line interface (running [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) under the hood), making it simple to interact with ChatGPT, either for quick one-off questions or more complex, context-driven interactions. Plus, it can be easily integrated into your existing workflows or automation scripts.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 **Harness the Power of ChatGPT**: By combining the capabilities of ChatGPT with gptty's context-preserving features and query support, you can unlock a wide range of applications, from answering technical questions to generating code snippets, and so much more.\n\n\ud83d\udd00 **Support for All Completion Models**: gptty currently supports all [Completion models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility), providing developers with the flexibility to choose the model that best suits their specific use case or application. This ensures that you can make the most of the OpenAI API and its various models without having to switch between different tools.\n\n\ud83d\udd0c **Planned Plug-and-Play Support for ChatCompletion Models**: We're working on adding plug-and-play support for [ChatCompletion models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility) (including GPT-4 and GPT-3-turbo). This means that you'll be able to seamlessly integrate GPT-4 into your gptty setup and continue leveraging the power of the latest generation of language models.\n\nTo get started, simply install gptty using `pip`:\n\n    pip install gptty\n\nCheck out the **GitHub repo** for detailed documentation and examples on how to make the most of gptty: [https://github.com/signebedi/gptty/](https://github.com/signebedi/gptty/).
