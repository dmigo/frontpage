{"title":"Modeling methodology","description":"Hello,\n\nI'm a bit lost about the methodology for modeling a model.Should I first optimize my input data (for eg find optimal window size for time serie data) based on a simple DL model ? But if I do that on a simple model maybe a more complex model would get better performance with another time window.\n\nAlso, should I optimize learning rate after or before batch size ?\n\nOr simply throw all params into a grid search and run the grid search for each model structure ?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/12466cu/modeling_methodology/","created":"2023-03-28","tags":["reddit","deeplearning","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":1}}
{"title":"Image Classification","description":"I am trying to classify images of some biological organisms as per their taxonomical hierarchy. It means, instead of single label, I want multiple hierarchical labels in the result for each image. \n\nI am considering the following taxonomic levels: phyllum, class, order, genus.  The broadest category/label being Phyllum, and the finest being Genus. \n\nEarlier I had done the classification with only one label which was Genus. Now instead of the result only telling me the Genus, I want it to tell the Order, Class, and Phyllum it belongs to as well. I have the taxonomy details for each class in my dataset; I have 4 classes belonging to 4 different Genus. \n\nI know I can just make my code print the backward hierarchy (Order, Class, and Phyllum) if a Genus name is shown in the result because the hierarchy is fixed and universal. But I want to approach this problem in a more sophisticated way using more advanced deep learning methods.\n\nAny ideas what I can use?\n\nThank you for your time.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/123qdjs/image_classification/","created":"2023-03-27","tags":["reddit","deeplearning","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}

{"title":"Beginner Seeking Advice on OCR Problem","description":"Hi reddit,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need some guidance on what I believe is a machine learning / deep learning project. If nothing else, please, help me help myself! Resources of any kind would be much appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Problem Statement:**\n\nI want to parse *images of* PDF form submissions. The forms will sometimes include *handwriting* and sometimes the structure of the form submitted *might vary slightly.* Again, these are ultimately images of forms im parsing, not the pdf file type itself. They are multi page, but i'm only interested in a small subset of the info on the first page. That about sums it up. There are at least 100 of these forms for each of the last 10-20 years, so there is some data i could use for training if necessary.  \n\nWould show image examples but don't want to reveal people's personal info. ... the forms look like a tax form,lots of boxes within one big box, some boxes are small with bold text indicating a field, some boxes are bigger for user input (sometimes handwritten, sometimes typed). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI've done some research on reddit and found people post questions with similar problem statements...but nothing that fit mine in all the critical conditions (e.g, solution not applicable to images, or to handwritten stuff, etc). Some have said this is a deep learning problem, some say no. I've heard this is called an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) problem, but that's about all I know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/123qjqm/beginner_seeking_advice_on_ocr_problem/","created":"2023-03-27","tags":["reddit","deeplearning","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":1}}

{"title":"Looking for book recommendations on [Geometric] Deep Learning","description":"Hi everyone, I'm new to this sub so please let me know if I am violating any rule by asking this type of question.   \nI'm a graduate student in Italy studying Applied Mathematics and recently I just started a course in differential geometry. A few days ago, I came up against [this seminar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtZV82LCNHc&amp;list=PLJ1v1ouVb6bCBajvaqvsFKjnIO72NcfCD&amp;index=1&amp;t=35s) about manifold learning in computer vision by Richard Hartley and just got more and more hooked on the topic of geometric Deep Learning. I would like to write my thesis on the topic and to start learning more about it I decided to follow [this online course by M. Bronstein](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2-dEmQeTfQ8YVuHBOvAhUlnIPYxkeu3) on geometric Deep Learning.   \n\n\nWhile I think my mathematical foundations are solid enough, I think I will have some trouble with the topics related to DL, so I was planning in buying a book on DL (it was long overdue) to keep as a reference throughout the course.   \nI found these two books quite interesting, but unfortunately, there are not many reviews on them, so it's quite difficult for me to understand which one would be the best fit for my use. The books:\n\n*  *Deep Learning Architectures: A Mathematical ApproachDeep Learning Architectures: A Mathematical Approach*    by Ovidiu Calin\n*  *Geometry of Deep Learning: A Signal Processing Perspectiv**e*   by  Jong Chul Ye \n\nSo I'm kindly asking you if you had any suggestions for the books (also ones not listed like the Goodfellow book if you think it's better). Also, more general tips and pieces of advice are very welcome:)  \n Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to answer my question.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/122p2go/looking_for_book_recommendations_on_geometric/","created":"2023-03-26","tags":["reddit","deeplearning","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":2}}
