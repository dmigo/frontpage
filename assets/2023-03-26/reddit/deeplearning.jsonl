{"title":"Using Stable Diffusion's training method for Reverse engineering?","description":"Bellow is what I know about Stable diffusion\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* The base model of the Stable Diffusion is orignially trained for removing noises in images.\n* With a given training image, a series of images are created by repeatedly adding noise to the previous image. \n* The model is trained to revert this process, removing noises repeatedly to create the original image. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan't this training method be used for training a reverse engineering model?\n\nA model that can create C, C++,  or some language code from a binary code?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Make compiler to output not only the binary code but also every code that occurs in the middle steps; hence, make a series of code that begins from the original source code and ends to the binary code(or just assembly code.).\n2. Train a model to revert each code to its previous code in the series.\n3. A model that can retrieve a source code from a binary code is created. \n4. Maybe, it can be trained and updated further, to accept text instruction, like Stable Diffusion.

If you choose your retraining data correctly, you can fine-tune your smaller model to perform better than the state-of-the-art GPT-X. The future of LLMs might look more open-source than imagined 3 months back?\n\nWould love to hear everyone's opinions on how they see the future of LLMs evolving? Will it be few players (OpenAI) cracking the AGI and conquering the whole world or a lot of smaller open-source models which ML engineers fine-tune for their use-cases?\n\nP.S. I am kinda betting on the latter and building [UpTrain](https://github.com/uptrain-ai/uptrain), an open-source project which helps you collect that high quality fine-tuning dataset","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/121agx4/do_we_really_need_100b_parameters_in_a_large/","created":"2023-03-25","tags":["reddit","ml","deeplearning"],"meta":{"num_comments":45}}

{"title":"LTSM to improve autonomous navigation","description":"I'm using DRL to train a model that allows a mobile robot to navigate its environment autonomously (without using a map).\n\nIn the DRL's model, the neural network is completely feedforward. Nothing fancy, just basic layers above layers and the performance is good. It is even good in the case of dynamic obstacles but in the same time, dynamic obstacles are usually humans that already navigate well but when two robots running the same model, a weird behavior happens and a collision is not out of the question. \n\nAnother problem I'm facing is the fact that sometimes the robot stucks at a local optimum, depending on the reward function I'm using.\n\nI've been reading around that having LTSM layers can improve the behavior by 'adding memory'. That memory should make it recognize a local from a global optimum and make it behave better if a dynamic obstacle is around its local proximity. But why? I'm not an expert in DL and all the articles on LTSM seems blunt and mathematical. \n\nCan somebody explain the core idea of LTSMs in an easy way?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/120fbfl/ltsm_to_improve_autonomous_navigation/","created":"2023-03-24","tags":["reddit","ml","deeplearning"],"meta":{"num_comments":2}}
