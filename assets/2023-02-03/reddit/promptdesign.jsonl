{"title":"Test to work as prompt engineer","description":"Hey hi I recently send an aplication to prompt engineer and now I have to do a test, I dont know what a prompt engineer do, I thinked I will have to input prompts to an IA like chat gpt or stable diffusion thing I have done before with cool photos with stable diffusio, but they ask me things about data and differents IAs and I dont know what I have to do, So the main question, a prompt engineer has to know how to code and input data to an AI or only writing prompts to get a desired result?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptDesign/comments/10qhqyo/test_to_work_as_prompt_engineer/","created":"2023-02-01","tags":["prompteng","reddit","promptdesign"],"meta":{"num_comments":6}}
