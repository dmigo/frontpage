{"title":"Why are FPGAs better than GPUs for deep learning?","description":"I've worked for some years developing scientific applications for GPUs. Recently we've been trying to integrate FPGAs into our technologies; and consequently I've been trying to understand what they are useful for.\n\nI've found many posts here and there that claim that FPGAs are better suited than GPUs to accelerate Deep Learning/AI workloads (for example, [this one by Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/programmable/fpga-gpu.html)). However, I don't understand why that would be the case. I think the problem is that all those posts try to explain what an FPGA is and what its differences are to a GPU, so that people that work on Deep Learning understand why they are better suited. Nevertheless, my position is exactly the opposite: I know quite well how a GPU works and what it is good for, I know well enough how an FPGA works and how it differs from a GPU, **but I do not know enough about Deep Learning** to understand why Deep Learning applicatios would benefit more from the special features of FPGAs rather than from the immense parallelism GPUs offers.\n\nAs far as I know, an FPGA will never beat a traditional GPU in terms of raw parallelism (or, if it does, it would be much less cost efficient). Thus, when it comes to matrix multiplications, i.e. the main operation in Deep Learning models, or convolutions, GPUs can parallelly work with much bigger matrices. The only explanation I can think of is that traditional Deep Learning applications don't necessarily use such big matrices, but rather smaller ones that can also be fully parallelized in FPGAs and benefit highly from custom-hardware optimizations (optimized matrix multiplications/tensor operations, working with reduced-bit values such as FP16, deep-pipeline parallelism, ...). However, given the recent increase in popularity of very complex models (GPT-3, dall-e, and the like) which boast using millions or even billions of parameters, it is hard to imagine that popular deep learning models work with small matrices of which fully parallel architectures can be synthesized in FPGAs.\n\nWhat am I missing? Any insight will be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/10s3u1s/why_are_fpgas_better_than_gpus_for_deep_learning/","created":"2023-02-03","tags":["reddit","ml","deeplearning"],"meta":{"num_comments":6}}

Additionally I have information about their role, title, business unit etc... so my data looks something like\n\n    User Data:\n    Section 1: User information: \n    [name, title, business unit] \n    \n    Section 2: Network information specific to this user  \n    [network activity as a time series, ex: \"2021-01-12 13:12:005 &lt;src IP&gt; &lt;dest IP&gt; &lt;user agent&gt; &lt;src port&gt;&lt;dest port&gt;\"] \n\nI thought about creating a folder structure with each folder having the individual's name, and the folder containing their network data, but it seems I would lose the additional user information.
