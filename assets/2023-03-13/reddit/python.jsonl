{"title":"procedurally generated fantasy names","description":"Hello! This is one of my first projects in python. What this does is constructs a name from scratch. I found most \"name generators\" just pull from a list of predefined names and spit one or some out. Instead, this \"procedurally\" generates, if you will names based on syllables that it constructs and then joins together. I started this Friday night and it was my first time working with a GUI so I am pretty proud of what has come out so far. I have some ideas for additions but at its core as of right now it does exactly what I want it to do. It has options to export the names to a CSV file, or to copy to your clipboard as either text or an image to share elsewhere.\n\n[https://github.com/Lanecrest/RanGen-Fantasy-Names](https://github.com/Lanecrest/RanGen-Fantasy-Names)\n\nI am happy to hear what anyone has to think about the app itself or also any suggestions to the code, etc :)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11pzdej/procedurally_generated_fantasy_names/","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":4}}

{"title":"Need Guidance on Python Script","description":"I'm a sales and online marketer by trait with 16 years experience working with 4 different agencies here in Austin, Texas. I'm not a programmer. But I have about a dozen projects under my belt and worked with a lot programmers in the past. And I see the value of these python tools and emerging technologies that make everything easier today it seems like. \n\nI wanted to know, what would be the best route to take because I have two types of solutions I want to create while trying to weigh in on expense and time.\n\nOne is a Google Maps email lead scrapper tool.(linkedin also) This is right down my alley as I already have a word of mouth social media referral app. \n\nAnd this other solution is social media listening tool that could track keywords/tags from posts on social networks. (sentiment analysis) This one brings way more value to the table and would be my first priority because it could easily sell as high ticket offer.\n\nI want to hire python expert or find partner with sweat equity. Due to this situation. I don't want to take on the wrong project. I'm trying to weight the difference between which one requires more advanced programmer or has the least possible technical  hurdles for a team of two? One marketer and one programmer.\n\nFYI:\n\nI'm planning to add this gmaps scrapper tool as 90 day freebie for attendees of my webinar class. The app Im promoting is a lead generation referral app called friendloops. And basically it's a high ticket sales webinar. Whoever doesn't bye the referral app on this webinar, are then placed into a sales funnel that sells gmaps scrapper on monthly subscription.\n\nThe reason I'm sharing this much detail is because I don't want people to think I'm just throwing things up in the air to see if they stick. I plan to plug in the gmaps scrapper(or listening tool) into a sales funnel along side a social omni present retargeting campaign. The very same campaigns I used to create for marketing agencies promoting their solution here in Austin, across the country. I'll be using my own money to fund the funnels.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11pv6om/need_guidance_on_python_script/","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":9}}

For example, I automated the process of requesting an imagined image of what buildings might look like if humans settled on Mars from ChatGPT and then having a picture drawn based on the results.\n\nI've attached pictures drawn by Karlo API from Kakao and DALL-E from OpenAI. The impressive thing is that the results of the different AIs' interpretations based on ChatGPT's imaginative input are unique and meaningful.

{"title":"Can we expand on the usage of the walrus operator?","description":"I found a way to run asynchronous tasks using `asyncio.gather` and immediately assign the first result to a variable. This is nice, because it uses fewer lines of code. The idea is that here one task returns the result directly, whilst the other stores the result in a class attributes. This is what the syntax looks like:\n\n    response = (_ :=  await asyncio.gather(\n        send_get_request(*args),\n        some_class.load_some_data()\n    ))[0]\n\nIt works because the walrus assignment is execute first, and the result of `gather` is stored in the temporary variable `_`. Now I can get the desired response using the desired index. I know in this example there might be a better way to perform this task, like so:\n\n    response, _ = await asyncio.gather(\n        send_get_request(*args),\n        some_class.load_some_data()\n    )\n\nCan someone think of a scenario where the  `(_ := &lt;some_task&gt; )` is useful?
