{"title":"Breaking Common Sense: WHOOPS! A Vision-and-Language Benchmark of Synthetic and Compositional Images","description":"Weird, unusual, and uncanny images pique the curiosity of observers because they challenge commonsense. For example, an image released during the 2022 world cup depicts the famous soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess, which playfully violates our expectation that their competition should occur on the football field. Humans can easily recognize and interpret these unconventional images, but can AI models do the same? We introduce WHOOPS!, a new dataset and benchmark for visual commonsense. The dataset is comprised of purposefully commonsense-defying images created by designers using publicly-available image generation tools like Midjourney. We consider several tasks posed over the dataset. In addition to image captioning, cross-modal matching, and visual question answering, we introduce a difficult explanation generation task, where models must identify and explain why a given image is unusual. Our results show that state-of-the-art models such as GPT3 and BLIP2 still lag behind human performance on WHOOPS!. We hope our dataset will inspire the development of AI models with stronger visual commonsense reasoning abilities.

{"title":"The Audio-Visual BatVision Dataset for Research on Sight and Sound","description":"Vision research showed remarkable success in understanding our world, propelled by datasets of images and videos. Sensor data from radar, LiDAR and cameras supports research in robotics and autonomous driving for at least a decade. However, while visual sensors may fail in some conditions, sound has recently shown potential to complement sensor data. Simulated room impulse responses (RIR) in 3D apartment-models became a benchmark dataset for the community, fostering a range of audiovisual research. In simulation, depth is predictable from sound, by learning bat-like perception with a neural network. Concurrently, the same was achieved in reality by using RGB-D images and echoes of chirping sounds. Biomimicking bat perception is an exciting new direction but needs dedicated datasets to explore the potential. Therefore, we collected the BatVision dataset to provide large-scale echoes in complex real-world scenes to the community. We equipped a robot with a speaker to emit chirps and a binaural microphone to record their echoes. Synchronized RGB-D images from the same perspective provide visual labels of traversed spaces. We sampled modern US office spaces to historic French university grounds, indoor and outdoor with large architectural variety. This dataset will allow research on robot echolocation, general audio-visual tasks and sound phaenomena unavailable in simulated data. We show promising results for audio-only depth prediction and show how state-of-the-art work developed for simulated data can also succeed on our dataset.

For an AI system to successfully reason about both, it needs to be able to combine symbolic reasoning of objective facts with the shared consensus found on subjective user reviews. To this end we introduce the NeuroQL dataset and DSL (Domain-specific Language) as a baseline solution for this problem.

{"title":"FireRisk: A Remote Sensing Dataset for Fire Risk Assessment with Benchmarks Using Supervised and Self-supervised Learning","description":"In recent decades, wildfires, as widespread and extremely destructive natural disasters, have caused tremendous property losses and fatalities, as well as extensive damage to forest ecosystems. Many fire risk assessment projects have been proposed to prevent wildfires, but GIS-based methods are inherently challenging to scale to different geographic areas due to variations in data collection and local conditions. Inspired by the abundance of publicly available remote sensing projects and the burgeoning development of deep learning in computer vision, our research focuses on assessing fire risk using remote sensing imagery.   In this work, we propose a novel remote sensing dataset, FireRisk, consisting of 7 fire risk classes with a total of 91872 labelled images for fire risk assessment. This remote sensing dataset is labelled with the fire risk classes supplied by the Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) raster dataset, and remote sensing images are collected using the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), a high-resolution remote sensing imagery program. On FireRisk, we present benchmark performance for supervised and self-supervised representations, with Masked Autoencoders (MAE) pre-trained on ImageNet1k achieving the highest classification accuracy, 65.29%.

{"title":"Identifying Label Errors in Object Detection Datasets by Loss Inspection","description":"Labeling datasets for supervised object detection is a dull and time-consuming task. Errors can be easily introduced during annotation and overlooked during review, yielding inaccurate benchmarks and performance degradation of deep neural networks trained on noisy labels. In this work, we for the first time introduce a benchmark for label error detection methods on object detection datasets as well as a label error detection method and a number of baselines. We simulate four different types of randomly introduced label errors on train and test sets of well-labeled object detection datasets. For our label error detection method we assume a two-stage object detector to be given and consider the sum of both stages' classification and regression losses. The losses are computed with respect to the predictions and the noisy labels including simulated label errors, aiming at detecting the latter. We compare our method to three baselines: a naive one without deep learning, the object detector's score and the entropy of the classification softmax distribution. We outperform all baselines and demonstrate that among the considered methods, ours is the only one that detects label errors of all four types efficiently. Furthermore, we detect real label errors a) on commonly used test datasets in object detection and b) on a proprietary dataset. In both cases we achieve low false positives rates, i.e., when considering 200 proposals from our method, we detect label errors with a precision for a) of up to 71.5% and for b) with 97%.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06999v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}
{"title":"Uni3D: A Unified Baseline for Multi-dataset 3D Object Detection","description":"Current 3D object detection models follow a single dataset-specific training and testing paradigm, which often faces a serious detection accuracy drop when they are directly deployed in another dataset. In this paper, we study the task of training a unified 3D detector from multiple datasets. We observe that this appears to be a challenging task, which is mainly due to that these datasets present substantial data-level differences and taxonomy-level variations caused by different LiDAR types and data acquisition standards. Inspired by such observation, we present a Uni3D which leverages a simple data-level correction operation and a designed semantic-level coupling-and-recoupling module to alleviate the unavoidable data-level and taxonomy-level differences, respectively. Our method is simple and easily combined with many 3D object detection baselines such as PV-RCNN and Voxel-RCNN, enabling them to effectively learn from multiple off-the-shelf 3D datasets to obtain more discriminative and generalizable representations. Experiments are conducted on many dataset consolidation settings including Waymo-nuScenes, nuScenes-KITTI, Waymo-KITTI, and Waymo-nuScenes-KITTI consolidations. Their results demonstrate that Uni3D exceeds a series of individual detectors trained on a single dataset, with a 1.04x parameter increase over a selected baseline detector. We expect this work will inspire the research of 3D generalization since it will push the limits of perceptual performance.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06880v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

The most recently proposed approach to PSI in the database community was Prism, which is built upon secret sharing and the assumption that multiple non-colluding servers are available. One limitation of Prism lies in its semantic security: the encoding on the servers is deterministic, implying that the scheme cannot be indistinguishable under a chosen-plaintext attack (IND-CPA). This paper extends the original PSI scheme of Prism by two orthogonal primitives, namely Kaleido-RND and Kaleido-AES: the former exhibits highly efficient performance with randomized encoding and the latter is provably secure under CPA attacks with more computational overhead. A system prototype is implemented and deployed on a 34-node cluster of SQLite instances. Extensive experiments on the TPC-H benchmark and three real-world applications confirm the effectiveness of the proposed Kaleido primitives.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06863v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

However, high-intensity noise in low-light images amplifies the effect of structure inconsistency between RGB-NIR images, which fails existing algorithms. To handle this, we propose a new RGB-NIR fusion algorithm called Dark Vision Net (DVN) with two technical novelties: Deep Structure and Deep Inconsistency Prior (DIP). The Deep Structure extracts clear structure details in deep multiscale feature space rather than raw input space, which is more robust to noisy inputs. Based on the deep structures from both RGB and NIR domains, we introduce the DIP to leverage the structure inconsistency to guide the fusion of RGB-NIR. Benefiting from this, the proposed DVN obtains high-quality lowlight images without the visual artifacts. We also propose a new dataset called Dark Vision Dataset (DVD), consisting of aligned RGB-NIR image pairs, as the first public RGBNIR fusion benchmark. Quantitative and qualitative results on the proposed benchmark show that DVN significantly outperforms other comparison algorithms in PSNR and SSIM, especially in extremely low light conditions.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06834v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

{"title":"Beyond Single Items: Exploring User Preferences in Item Sets with the Conversational Playlist Curation Dataset","description":"Users in consumption domains, like music, are often able to more efficiently provide preferences over a set of items (e.g. a playlist or radio) than over single items (e.g. songs). Unfortunately, this is an underexplored area of research, with most existing recommendation systems limited to understanding preferences over single items. Curating an item set exponentiates the search space that recommender systems must consider (all subsets of items!): this motivates conversational approaches-where users explicitly state or refine their preferences and systems elicit preferences in natural language-as an efficient way to understand user needs. We call this task conversational item set curation and present a novel data collection methodology that efficiently collects realistic preferences about item sets in a conversational setting by observing both item-level and set-level feedback. We apply this methodology to music recommendation to build the Conversational Playlist Curation Dataset (CPCD), where we show that it leads raters to express preferences that would not be otherwise expressed. Finally, we propose a wide range of conversational retrieval models as baselines for this task and evaluate them on the dataset.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06791v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","dataset"],"meta":{"query":"ti:dataset OR ti:corpus OR ti:database OR abs:\"a new dataset\""}}

However, characterizing the optimality, particularly the minimax lower bound, under privacy constraints is technically difficult.   To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called the score attack, which provides a lower bound on the differential-privacy-constrained minimax risk of parameter estimation. The score attack method is based on the tracing attack concept in differential privacy and can be applied to any statistical model with a well-defined score statistic. It can optimally lower bound the minimax risk of estimating unknown model parameters, up to a logarithmic factor, while ensuring differential privacy for a range of statistical problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness and optimality of this general method in various examples, such as the generalized linear model in both classical and high-dimensional sparse settings, the Bradley-Terry-Luce model for pairwise comparisons, and nonparametric regression over the Sobolev class.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07152v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}

However, many studies in the field of computer vision have shown that ML can be fooled by intentionally crafted instances, called adversarial examples. These adversarial examples take advantage of the intrinsic vulnerability of ML models. Recent research raises many concerns in the cybersecurity field. An increasing number of researchers are studying the feasibility of such attacks on security systems based on ML algorithms, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). The feasibility of such adversarial attacks would be influenced by various domain-specific constraints. This can potentially increase the difficulty of crafting adversarial examples. Despite the considerable amount of research that has been done in this area, much of it focuses on showing that it is possible to fool a model using features extracted from the raw data but does not address the practical side, i.e., the reverse transformation from theory to practice. For this reason, we propose a review browsing through various important papers to provide a comprehensive analysis. Our analysis highlights some challenges that have not been addressed in the reviewed papers.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07003v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Robust Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining against Adversarial Attacks","description":"Contrastive vision-language representation learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot classification, by learning from millions of image-caption pairs crawled from the internet. However, the massive data that powers large multimodal models such as CLIP, makes them extremely vulnerable to various types of adversarial attacks, including targeted and backdoor data poisoning attacks. Despite this vulnerability, robust contrastive vision-language pretraining against adversarial attacks has remained unaddressed. In this work, we propose RoCLIP, the first effective method for robust pretraining {and fine-tuning} multimodal vision-language models. RoCLIP effectively breaks the association between poisoned image-caption pairs by considering a pool of random examples, and (1) matching every image with the text that is most similar to its caption in the pool, and (2) matching every caption with the image that is most similar to its image in the pool. Our extensive experiments show that our method renders state-of-the-art targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks ineffective during pre-training or fine-tuning of CLIP. In particular, RoCLIP decreases the poison and backdoor attack success rates down to 0\\% during pre-training and 1\\%-4\\% during fine-tuning, and effectively improves the model's performance.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06854v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","ml","security"],"meta":{"query":"machine AND learning AND security OR machine AND learning AND secure"}}
{"title":"Backdoor Defense via Deconfounded Representation Learning","description":"Deep neural networks (DNNs) are recently shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers embed hidden backdoors in the DNN model by injecting a few poisoned examples into the training dataset. While extensive efforts have been made to detect and remove backdoors from backdoored DNNs, it is still not clear whether a backdoor-free clean model can be directly obtained from poisoned datasets. In this paper, we first construct a causal graph to model the generation process of poisoned data and find that the backdoor attack acts as the confounder, which brings spurious associations between the input images and target labels, making the model predictions less reliable. Inspired by the causal understanding, we propose the Causality-inspired Backdoor Defense (CBD), to learn deconfounded representations for reliable classification. Specifically, a backdoored model is intentionally trained to capture the confounding effects. The other clean model dedicates to capturing the desired causal effects by minimizing the mutual information with the confounding representations from the backdoored model and employing a sample-wise re-weighting scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets against 6 state-of-the-art attacks verify that our proposed defense method is effective in reducing backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in predicting benign samples. Further analysis shows that CBD can also resist potential adaptive attacks.

{"title":"InferFix: End-to-End Program Repair with LLMs","description":"Software development life cycle is profoundly influenced by bugs: their introduction, identification, and eventual resolution account for a significant portion of software cost. This has motivated software engineering researchers and practitioners to propose different approaches for automating the identification and repair of software defects. Large language models have been adapted to the program repair task through few-shot demonstration learning and instruction prompting, treating this as an infilling task. However, these models have only focused on learning general bug-fixing patterns for uncategorized bugs mined from public repositories. In this paper, we propose InferFix: a transformer-based program repair framework paired with a state-of-the-art static analyzer to fix critical security and performance bugs. InferFix combines a Retriever -- transformer encoder model pretrained via contrastive learning objective, which aims at searching for semantically equivalent bugs and corresponding fixes; and a Generator -- a large language model (Codex Cushman) finetuned on supervised bug-fix data with prompts augmented via bug type annotations and semantically similar fixes retrieved from an external non-parametric memory. To train and evaluate our approach, we curated InferredBugs, a novel, metadata-rich dataset of bugs extracted by executing the Infer static analyzer on the change histories of thousands of Java and C# repositories. Our evaluation demonstrates that InferFix outperforms strong LLM baselines, with a top-1 accuracy of 65.6% for generating fixes in C# and 76.8% in Java.

In Geant4, low energy neutrons are transported using evaluated data libraries handled by the Neutron High-Precision (Neutron-HP) package. Version 11.00.p03 of the code features in particular the Doppler broadened elastic scattering kernel, provided by the so-called 'Sampling of the Velocity of the Target' (SVT) method. However this latter fails for resonant heavy nuclei such as 238U and can severely impact the solving of the Boltzmann equation in fissile media. To overcome this shortcoming, the Doppler Broadened Rejection Correction (DBRC) method has been implemented in Geant4 and successfully validated with the reference Monte Carlo neutron transport code Tripoli4 (version 11). This development will be taken into account in the next release of the code. The cross section Doppler broadening process, which is performed on-the-fly, is also carefully investigated and ways to improve it on a simulation-by-simulation basis are presented.

{"title":"InPL: Pseudo-labeling the Inliers First for Imbalanced Semi-supervised Learning","description":"Recent state-of-the-art methods in imbalanced semi-supervised learning (SSL) rely on confidence-based pseudo-labeling with consistency regularization. To obtain high-quality pseudo-labels, a high confidence threshold is typically adopted. However, it has been shown that softmax-based confidence scores in deep networks can be arbitrarily high for samples far from the training data, and thus, the pseudo-labels for even high-confidence unlabeled samples may still be unreliable. In this work, we present a new perspective of pseudo-labeling for imbalanced SSL. Without relying on model confidence, we propose to measure whether an unlabeled sample is likely to be ``in-distribution''; i.e., close to the current training data. To decide whether an unlabeled sample is ``in-distribution'' or ``out-of-distribution'', we adopt the energy score from out-of-distribution detection literature. As training progresses and more unlabeled samples become in-distribution and contribute to training, the combined labeled and pseudo-labeled data can better approximate the true class distribution to improve the model. Experiments demonstrate that our energy-based pseudo-labeling method, \\textbf{InPL}, albeit conceptually simple, significantly outperforms confidence-based methods on imbalanced SSL benchmarks. For example, it produces around 3\\% absolute accuracy improvement on CIFAR10-LT. When combined with state-of-the-art long-tailed SSL methods, further improvements are attained. In particular, in one of the most challenging scenarios, InPL achieves a 6.9\\% accuracy improvement over the best competitor.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07269v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}

The normal-based depth initialization network trained with self-supervised normal consistency loss provides depth map initialization to the normal-depth refinement module, which utilizes the relationship between illumination and surface normals to refine the frame-wise normal and depth predictions recursively. Our framework's depth accuracy performance on phantom colonoscopy data demonstrates the value of exploiting the surface normals in colonoscopy reconstruction, especially on en face views.

{"title":"Mobile Mapping Mesh Change Detection and Update","description":"Mobile mapping, in particular, Mobile Lidar Scanning (MLS) is increasingly widespread to monitor and map urban scenes at city scale with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. The resulting point cloud sampling of the scene geometry can be meshed in order to create a continuous representation for different applications: visualization, simulation, navigation, etc. Because of the highly dynamic nature of these urban scenes, long term mapping should rely on frequent map updates. A trivial solution is to simply replace old data with newer data each time a new acquisition is made. However it has two drawbacks: 1) the old data may be of higher quality (resolution, precision) than the new and 2) the coverage of the scene might be different in various acquisitions, including varying occlusions. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic pipeline to address these two issues by formulating the problem of merging meshes with different quality, coverage and acquisition time. Our method is based on a combined distance and visibility based change detection, a time series analysis to assess the sustainability of changes, a mesh mosaicking based on a global boolean optimization and finally a stitching of the resulting mesh pieces boundaries with triangle strips.

However, conventional pre-deployment model generation approaches are not satisfactory due to the difficulty of handling the diversity of edge environments and the demand for edge information. In this paper, we propose to adapt the model architecture after deployment in the target environment, where the model quality can be precisely measured and private edge data can be retained. To achieve efficient and effective edge model generation, we introduce a pretraining-assisted on-cloud model elastification method and an edge-friendly on-device architecture search method. Model elastification generates a high-quality search space of model architectures with the guidance of a developer-specified oracle model. Each subnet in the space is a valid model with different environment affinity, and each device efficiently finds and maintains the most suitable subnet based on a series of edge-tailored optimizations. Extensive experiments on various edge devices demonstrate that our approach is able to achieve significantly better accuracy-latency tradeoffs (e.g. 46.74\\% higher on average accuracy with a 60\\% latency budget) than strong baselines with minimal overhead (13 GPU hours in the cloud and 2 minutes on the edge server).","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07129v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"xASTNN: Improved Code Representations for Industrial Practice","description":"The application of deep learning techniques in software engineering becomes increasingly popular. One key problem is developing high-quality and easy-to-use source code representations for code-related tasks. The research community has acquired impressive results in recent years. However, due to the deployment difficulties and performance bottlenecks, seldom these approaches are applied to the industry. In this paper, we present xASTNN, an eXtreme Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based Neural Network for source code representation, aiming to push this technique to industrial practice. The proposed xASTNN has three advantages. First, xASTNN is completely based on widely-used ASTs and does not require complicated data pre-processing, making it applicable to various programming languages and practical scenarios. Second, three closely-related designs are proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of xASTNN, including statement subtree sequence for code naturalness, gated recursive unit for syntactical information, and gated recurrent unit for sequential information. Third, a dynamic batching algorithm is introduced to significantly reduce the time complexity of xASTNN. Two code comprehension downstream tasks, code classification and code clone detection, are adopted for evaluation. The results demonstrate that our xASTNN can improve the state-of-the-art while being faster than the baselines.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07104v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"A Feature-based Approach for the Recognition of Image Quality Degradation in Automotive Applications","description":"Cameras play a crucial role in modern driver assistance systems and are an essential part of the sensor technology for automated driving. The quality of images captured by in-vehicle cameras highly influences the performance of visual perception systems. This paper presents a feature-based algorithm to detect certain effects that can degrade image quality in automotive applications. The algorithm is based on an intelligent selection of significant features. Due to the small number of features, the algorithm performs well even with small data sets. Experiments with different data sets show that the algorithm can detect soiling adhering to camera lenses and classify different types of image degradation.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07100v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Towards smoother surfaces by applying subdivision to voxel data","description":"In computed tomography, the approximation quality of a scan of a physical object is typically limited by the acquisition modalities, especially the hardware including X-ray detectors. To improve upon this, we experiment with a three-dimensional subdivision scheme to increase the resolution of the reconstructed voxel data. Subdivision schemes are often used to refine two-dimensional manifolds (mostly meshes) leading to smoother surfaces. In this work, we apply a refinement scheme to three-dimensional data first, and only then, start the surface extraction process. Thus, the main subject of this work lies not on subdivision surfaces, but rather on subdivision volumes. In the volumetric case, each subdivision iteration consumes eight times more storage space than the previous one. Hence, we restrict ourselves to a single subdivision iteration. We evaluate the quality of the produced subdivision volumes using synthetic and industrial data. Furthermore, we consider manufacturing errors in the original and in the subdivision volumes, extract their surfaces, and compare the resulting meshes in critical regions. Observations show that our specific choice of a subdivision scheme produces smoothly interpolated data while also preserving edges.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07075v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Bandit-supported care planning for older people with complex health and care needs","description":"Long-term care service for old people is in great demand in most of the aging societies. The number of nursing homes residents is increasing while the number of care providers is limited. Due to the care worker shortage, care to vulnerable older residents cannot be fully tailored to the unique needs and preference of each individual. This may bring negative impacts on health outcomes and quality of life among institutionalized older people. To improve care quality through personalized care planning and delivery with limited care workforce, we propose a new care planning model assisted by artificial intelligence. We apply bandit algorithms which optimize the clinical decision for care planning by adapting to the sequential feedback from the past decisions. We evaluate the proposed model on empirical data acquired from the Systems for Person-centered Elder Care (SPEC) study, a ICT-enhanced care management program.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07053v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Synthesizing Realistic Image Restoration Training Pairs: A Diffusion Approach","description":"In supervised image restoration tasks, one key issue is how to obtain the aligned high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) training image pairs. Unfortunately, such HQ-LQ training pairs are hard to capture in practice, and hard to synthesize due to the complex unknown degradation in the wild. While several sophisticated degradation models have been manually designed to synthesize LQ images from their HQ counterparts, the distribution gap between the synthesized and real-world LQ images remains large. We propose a new approach to synthesizing realistic image restoration training pairs using the emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).   First, we train a DDPM, which could convert a noisy input into the desired LQ image, with a large amount of collected LQ images, which define the target data distribution. Then, for a given HQ image, we synthesize an initial LQ image by using an off-the-shelf degradation model, and iteratively add proper Gaussian noises to it. Finally, we denoise the noisy LQ image using the pre-trained DDPM to obtain the final LQ image, which falls into the target distribution of real-world LQ images. Thanks to the strong capability of DDPM in distribution approximation, the synthesized HQ-LQ image pairs can be used to train robust models for real-world image restoration tasks, such as blind face image restoration and blind image super-resolution. Experiments demonstrated the superiority of our proposed approach to existing degradation models. Code and data will be released.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06994v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Distributionally Robust Chance-Constrained Optimization for Hierarchical UAV-based MEC","description":"Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is regarded as a promising technology in the sixth-generation communication. However, the antenna gain is always affected by the environment when unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are served as MEC platforms, resulting in unexpected channel errors. In order to deal with the problem and reduce the power consumption in the UAV-based MEC, we jointly optimize the access scheme and power allocation in the hierarchical UAV-based MEC. Specifically, UAVs are deployed in the lower layer to collect data from ground users. Moreover, a UAV with powerful computation ability is deployed in the upper layer to assist with computing. The goal is to guarantee the quality of service and minimize the total power consumption. We consider the errors caused by various perturbations in realistic circumstances and formulate a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization problem with an uncertainty set. The problem with chance constraints is intractable. To tackle this issue, we utilize the conditional value-at-risk method to reformulate the problem into a semidefinite programming form. Then, a joint algorithm for access scheme and power allocation is designed. Finally, we conduct simulations to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06933v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Pixel-wise Gradient Uncertainty for Convolutional Neural Networks applied to Out-of-Distribution Segmentation","description":"In recent years, deep neural networks have defined the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation where their predictions are constrained to a predefined set of semantic classes. They are to be deployed in applications such as automated driving, although their categorically confined expressive power runs contrary to such open world scenarios. Thus, the detection and segmentation of objects from outside their predefined semantic space, i.e., out-of-distribution (OoD) objects, is of highest interest. Since uncertainty estimation methods like softmax entropy or Bayesian models are sensitive to erroneous predictions, these methods are a natural baseline for OoD detection. Here, we present a method for obtaining uncertainty scores from pixel-wise loss gradients which can be computed efficiently during inference. Our approach is simple to implement for a large class of models, does not require any additional training or auxiliary data and can be readily used on pre-trained segmentation models. Our experiments show the ability of our method to identify wrong pixel classifications and to estimate prediction quality. In particular, we observe superior performance in terms of OoD segmentation to comparable baselines on the SegmentMeIfYouCan benchmark, clearly outperforming methods which are similarly flexible to implement.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06920v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"NeRFLiX: High-Quality Neural View Synthesis by Learning a Degradation-Driven Inter-viewpoint MiXer","description":"Neural radiance fields (NeRF) show great success in novel view synthesis. However, in real-world scenes, recovering high-quality details from the source images is still challenging for the existing NeRF-based approaches, due to the potential imperfect calibration information and scene representation inaccuracy. Even with high-quality training frames, the synthetic novel views produced by NeRF models still suffer from notable rendering artifacts, such as noise, blur, etc. Towards to improve the synthesis quality of NeRF-based approaches, we propose NeRFLiX, a general NeRF-agnostic restorer paradigm by learning a degradation-driven inter-viewpoint mixer. Specially, we design a NeRF-style degradation modeling approach and construct large-scale training data, enabling the possibility of effectively removing NeRF-native rendering artifacts for existing deep neural networks. Moreover, beyond the degradation removal, we propose an inter-viewpoint aggregation framework that is able to fuse highly related high-quality training images, pushing the performance of cutting-edge NeRF models to entirely new levels and producing highly photo-realistic synthetic views.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06919v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"ST360IQ: No-Reference Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment with Spherical Vision Transformers","description":"Omnidirectional images, aka 360 images, can deliver immersive and interactive visual experiences. As their popularity has increased dramatically in recent years, evaluating the quality of 360 images has become a problem of interest since it provides insights for capturing, transmitting, and consuming this new media. However, directly adapting quality assessment methods proposed for standard natural images for omnidirectional data poses certain challenges. These models need to deal with very high-resolution data and implicit distortions due to the spherical form of the images. In this study, we present a method for no-reference 360 image quality assessment. Our proposed ST360IQ model extracts tangent viewports from the salient parts of the input omnidirectional image and employs a vision-transformers based module processing saliency selective patches/tokens that estimates a quality score from each viewport. Then, it aggregates these scores to give a final quality score. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets, namely OIQA and CVIQ datasets, demonstrate that as compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach predicts the quality of an omnidirectional image correlated with the human-perceived image quality.

{"title":"DR2: Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover for Blind Face Restoration","description":"Blind face restoration usually synthesizes degraded low-quality data with a pre-defined degradation model for training, while more complex cases could happen in the real world. This gap between the assumed and actual degradation hurts the restoration performance where artifacts are often observed in the output. However, it is expensive and infeasible to include every type of degradation to cover real-world cases in the training data. To tackle this robustness issue, we propose Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover (DR2) to first transform the degraded image to a coarse but degradation-invariant prediction, then employ an enhancement module to restore the coarse prediction to a high-quality image. By leveraging a well-performing denoising diffusion probabilistic model, our DR2 diffuses input images to a noisy status where various types of degradation give way to Gaussian noise, and then captures semantic information through iterative denoising steps. As a result, DR2 is robust against common degradation (e.g. blur, resize, noise and compression) and compatible with different designs of enhancement modules. Experiments in various settings show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heavily degraded synthetic and real-world datasets.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06885v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"ODIN: On-demand Data Formulation to Mitigate Dataset Lock-in","description":"ODIN is an innovative approach that addresses the problem of dataset constraints by integrating generative AI models. Traditional zero-shot learning methods are constrained by the training dataset. To fundamentally overcome this limitation, ODIN attempts to mitigate the dataset constraints by generating on-demand datasets based on user requirements. ODIN consists of three main modules: a prompt generator, a text-to-image generator, and an image post-processor. To generate high-quality prompts and images, we adopted a large language model (e.g., ChatGPT), and a text-to-image diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion), respectively. We evaluated ODIN on various datasets in terms of model accuracy and data diversity to demonstrate its potential, and conducted post-experiments for further investigation. Overall, ODIN is a feasible approach that enables Al to learn unseen knowledge beyond the training dataset.","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06832v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
{"title":"Boosting Source Code Learning with Data Augmentation: An Empirical Study","description":"The next era of program understanding is being propelled by the use of machine learning to solve software problems. Recent studies have shown surprising results of source code learning, which applies deep neural networks (DNNs) to various critical software tasks, e.g., bug detection and clone detection. This success can be greatly attributed to the utilization of massive high-quality training data, and in practice, data augmentation, which is a technique used to produce additional training data, has been widely adopted in various domains, such as computer vision. However, in source code learning, data augmentation has not been extensively studied, and existing practice is limited to simple syntax-preserved methods, such as code refactoring. Essentially, source code is often represented in two ways, namely, sequentially as text data and structurally as graph data, when it is used as training data in source code learning. Inspired by these analogy relations, we take an early step to investigate whether data augmentation methods that are originally used for text and graphs are effective in improving the training quality of source code learning. To that end, we first collect and categorize data augmentation methods in the literature. Second, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on four critical tasks and 11 DNN architectures to explore the effectiveness of 12 data augmentation methods (including code refactoring and 11 other methods for text and graph data). Our results identify the data augmentation methods that can produce more accurate and robust models for source code learning, including those based on mixup (e.g., SenMixup for texts and Manifold-Mixup for graphs), and those that slightly break the syntax of source code (e.g., random swap and random deletion for texts).","link":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06808v1","created":"2023-03-13","tags":["arxiv","data-quality"],"meta":{"query":"data AND quality"}}
