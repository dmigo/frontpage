{"title":"Systematised Network Diagrams","description":"Hi all, I've been working on this neural network diagram convention for a few years now and would love to hear your feedback on it. I have personally found it useful, so I thought I would share it in case others would like to adopt it too.\n\nMy motivation was that almost every scientific paper uses a different diagrammatic system to depict their networks. This puts a burden on the reader to get to grips with the unique system, compounded with understanding the novel network displayed.\n\nThe aim of this system is to be modular, minimalistic, and consistent, enabling fast interpretation and universal communication of network architectures in scientific papers and presentations. This outlined key system is designed to represent clear, symbolic placeholders for mathematical functions, much like Feynman diagrams for quantum field theory or logic gates for mathematical logic. My [GitHub](https://github.com/GeorgeBird1/Diagramatic-Neural-Networks) page on this system offers an easy way to centralise, date, and update the convention. No accreditation is required when using this system for any purpose.\n\nIt is easy for hand drawing, with an included shorthand notation, alongside a more technical depiction for use in papers. All symbols are constructable using common flow-chart shapes for easy implementation.\n\nHere are some example networks I've drawn using this system:\n\n[Depiction of various types of neural network architectures using this system.](https://preview.redd.it/2geqegs3cqoa1.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=669c19ece3bc82fd2189f9e325da282a51b70ca5)\n\nHere are the basic key-components, more can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/GeorgeBird1/Diagramatic-Neural-Networks) link:\n\n[The basic key system for constructing diagrams.

{"title":"Best GPUs for pretraining roBERTa-size LLMs with a $50K budget, 4x RTX A6000 v.s. 4x A6000 ADA v.s. 2x A100 80GB","description":"Hi folks,\n\nOur lab plans to purchase a server with some decent GPUs to perform some pertaining tasks for program codes. We won't work on very large LLM and we even may not try the T5 model. Currently, we want to first try the roBERTa model. We have a $50K budget. And it's our first time purchasing GPU servers.\n\nI did some preliminary study and found the suggested GPU is A6000 ADA which has 48 GB GPU memory, according to [https://timdettmers.com/2023/01/30/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/](https://timdettmers.com/2023/01/30/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/). Since our tasks require lots of GPU memory, we think a GPU with more than 32 GB will be good for us. So our alternative choices are RTX A6000 and A100 80GB HBM2 cards. \n\nBased on these, we got three server specs from Exxact ( [https://www.exxactcorp.com/TWS-115999024/configurator](https://www.exxactcorp.com/TWS-115999024/configurator)), (1) a $43K spec with 4  A6000 ADA cards, (2) a $32K spec with 4 RTX A6000 cards, and (3) a $41K spec with 2 A100 80GB cards. The other parts in the specs, e.g., CPU and RAM, are almost the same. I have attached the specs in screenshots.\n\nNow, I have some questions. \n\n1. A6000 ADA removed NVLink ([https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/rtx-a6000-ada-no-more-nv-link-even-on-pro-gpus/230874](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/rtx-a6000-ada-no-more-nv-link-even-on-pro-gpus/230874)) which is very important for performance boosting and GPU memory pooling. Does this mean it's a good choice to have multiple A6000 ADA cards on a server?\n2. A6000 ADA is a very new GPU improved from RTX A6000. But it has the NVLink, which means the server GPU memory can reach 48 \\* 4 GB when connecting 4 RTX A6000 cards. However, we are going to use the GPU server for several years. For IT products, it's always better to purchase the latest ones. Is that true for GPU cards? And A6000 ADA has more tensor and cuda cores than RTX A6000. \n3. For the A100 80GB spec, we can only have 2 cards wondering the budget. For the LLM pertaining, more cards usually mean more parallelism and faster training. Based on my study, A6000 ADA has comparable performance to A100 on DL benchmarks. Is this A100 80GB spec a good choice?\n4. Except for the ahead-mentioned specs, what else would you recommend for our pretraining tasks, especially for GPUs?\n\nThanks for your time! We really appreciate any suggestions.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/11vb220/best_gpus_for_pretraining_robertasize_llms_with_a/","created":"2023-03-19","tags":["deeplearning","reddit","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":7}}
