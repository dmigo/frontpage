{"title":"Managing secrets like API keys in Python - Why are so many devs still hardcoding secrets?","description":"The recent [State of Secrets Sprawl report](https://www.gitguardian.com/state-of-secrets-sprawl-report-2023) showed that 10 million (yes million) secrets like API keys, credential pairs and security certs were leaked in public GitHub repositories in 2022 and Python was by far the largest contributor to these. \n\nThe problem stems mostly from secrets being hardcoded directly into the source code. So this leads to the question, why are so many devs hardcoding secrets? The problem is a little more complicated with git because often a secret is hardcoded and removed without the dev realizing that the secret persists in the git history. But still, this is a big issue in the Python community. \n\nManaging secrets can be really easy thanks to helpful Pypi packages like [Python Dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) which is my favorite for its simplicity and easy ability to manage secrets for multiple different environments like Dev and Prod. I'm curious about what others are using to manage secrets and why? \n\nI thought I'd share some recent tutorials on managing secrets for anyone who may need a refresher on the topic. Please share more resources in the comments.   \n\n\n[Managing Secrets in Python - Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVVYHlGYIHY)  \n\n\n[Managing Secrets in Python - Blog](https://blog.gitguardian.com/how-to-handle-secrets-in-python/)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11rqyv9/managing_secrets_like_api_keys_in_python_why_are/","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":3}}

{"title":"Python Beginner, Need some advice/route-map to get an Entry-level jobs.","description":"Hi everyone, Hope all is well with you all. I'm writing this to seek some advice from you all. I'm 30 and I have shifted my career from e-commerce to Python recently. I was working in a company in London and had to quit because of redundancy. Hence, I thought I need to upgrade my technical skills to find a stable job. I have been teaching myself python via an Online platform and practicing hackerranks,geeksforgeeks to practice python. It's been around 6 months now and to be honest, I'm quite afraid of how I'm going to find a job. what would be the expectations for a junior python-dev? how should I approach this situation?can i actually try for interviews without any certification in Python? or Should I get any? Any tips, or anything useful to me would be highly appreciated guys! I'm losing my confidence day by day as the journey takes a long time and worried. Please share your thoughts.
