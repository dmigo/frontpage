{"title":"Evaluation Methods for text segment matching","description":"Hi together,\n\nright now I'm working on my masters thesis with the goal of exploring the usage of Language Models for matching Information Security controls. I am having a few questions about the evaluation methods which I have used so far and some which I might have missed. \n\nA little background: \nI have created a data set based on existing mappings between the ISO27001 security framework and another IT security framework. \n\nThe data set is created in the following way:\nI have two sentences/paragraphs per training example, one ISO sentence and one paragraph (might be one sentence up to a full subchapter) from the other framework, and per each pair of sentences a similarity score which indicates their semantic overlap / if they \"fit together\" (derived from an official existing mapping which maps chapters of sentences from both frameworks to each other).\n\nThe task for the models is as follows: I want the models to create embeddings of the sentence pairs and learn to put those embeddings which \"fit together\", as indicated by the ground truth similarity score, close to each other, while pulling those sentence pairs which do not belong together farther away in the embedding space. Later on, I want to let the model encode previously unseen sentences (e.g. new ISO controls) and then use semantic search based on a distance metric, at first cosine similarity (or possibly other methods) to find the most similar sentences from another IT security framework, as to match them together.\n\nFor this task I am using a SentenceBERT variant as a strong baseline.\n\nIn terms of model evaluation I use a held out test set from a 80/20 train test split. On trained models, I have used two evaluation methods so far:\n\n1. Let the model encode sentence pairs from test set (where a ground truth cosine similarity score is known) and then calculate the Cosine similarity. Calculate Cosine similarity loss on test set.\n\n2. For each distinct sentence / ISO control in the test set, use this sentence as query for the trained model and let the model output the top-k most similar sentences from the second security framework. Compare the calculated top-k matches with the actual matches and calculate precision at k and recall at k.\n \nNow coming to the questions:\n\n1. Do you think that the evaluation methods I have used so far are appropriate for evaluating the models' performances on the task described above?\n\n2. Can you think of any other evaluation methods I might have missed? \n\n3. Do you possibly know of similar research, and if so, could you point me in this direction?\n\nI would appreciate any answers or feedback, feel free to point out any flaws if you do not mind.\nOh and also please excuse the formatting, I am typing this on my phone. \n\nThank you!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11r1jch/evaluation_methods_for_text_segment_matching/","created":"2023-03-14","tags":["ml","languagetechnology","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}
{"title":"Optimum Dataset for Sequence Labelling","description":"Hi everyone. I'm working on a custom NER like task.\n\nHowever some tags have very low frequency in the data. Hence mode is not good in predicting them.\n\nThis problem got me thinking what would the optimum dataset look like for such a task? \nShould number of samples for each label be similar? \nif we increase the data for all labels but keep a specific label same would it impact the preformance?\n\nPapers usually just take a toy dataset and tweak the model or data little bit.
