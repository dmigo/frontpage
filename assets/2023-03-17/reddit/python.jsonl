{"title":"The Ruff python linter is insanely good","description":"I just migrated some of my projects over to using [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff), and I am EXTREMELY impressed. It is quite literally 100 times faster than my previous linting configuration, all while being more organized and powerful. It's mind boggling fast. It has all of the plugins builtin that I was previously using with tools like flake8. It hooks into `pre-commit` and replaces many plugins I had before like:\n\n* `isort` - sorts imports\n* `bandit` - finds common security issues\n* `flake8` - linter; additional benefit is that I can now delete my \\`.flake8\\` file.\n* `pygrep-hooks` - common misc linting\n\nAdditionally, it's completely configurable via pyproject.toml, so that always feels good.\n\nBy the way, if you want to checkout my python template, it has my preferred ruff configuration:[https://github.com/BrianPugh/python-template](https://github.com/BrianPugh/python-template)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11syxd0/the_ruff_python_linter_is_insanely_good/","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":90}}

{"title":"Book recommendation, advanced+ level in Python","description":"Hello,\n\nI'd like to deepen my knowledge of Python. I'd like to make good decisions when writing Python code based on a solid foundation of **how Python works internally**.\n\nI have 7 YOE (but that doesn't tell much about my level), I think Python meta-programming level is something I found hardest to understand so far (because I needed it only 2x so far), hope this helps to better judge my level.\n\nI mostly created **web applications**, I'm not interested in machine learning or data science. My focus should ideally be on high-performant APIs in terms of response times and processing load. I realize for this I mostly have to rely on existing tools and good architecture, but I still feel I should have a deeper knowledge of Python itself.\n\nI'm a big fan of **async Python** so if the book goes in this direction too, I'd be happy.\n\nCan you please recommend a book that would fulfill this goal of mine? :) I'd prefer books written after asyncio started to be widely used.\n\nCourse recommendations are welcomed too, but it seems to me most of those are aimed at beginners.\n\nI appreciate your answers and the time spent answering here.  \n\n\nP.S. So far it seems **High Performance Python** might tick the boxes, but I'm not sure.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11t29at/book_recommendation_advanced_level_in_python/","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":13}}
{"title":"Here is how i made a 2D game using Python Matplotlib","description":"Im only few month into learning Python and i was wondering if i could make a game with it. I didnt know about any libraries created specifically for developing games at the time, so i asked an AI if i could somehow make a code that opens and plays GIF animations. AI came up with a function that opens GIFs as matplotlib plots. I added a condition that if 'space' button is pressed, the animation stops and the last frame number is saved into a variable, and then the value of the variable determines what happens next. This whole game is built around this simple algorithm.\n\nshowcase: [https://youtu.be/ZAXlaOWMgfM](https://youtu.be/ZAXlaOWMgfM)\n\nsource code: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bKV4\\_AdCgnW40A8B1kFkFYryIuTE44A6?usp=share\\_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bKV4_AdCgnW40A8B1kFkFYryIuTE44A6?usp=share_link)\n\n[icon](https://preview.redd.it/q6463xvfr4oa1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=68ba371480740ee9117b4fd4b68d1ef37554d4f2)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[QTE](https://preview.redd.it/kzjifyrkr4oa1.png?width=575&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3c45f92e81ba39711ea5ff760766e9ddf07e236d)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11szlvk/here_is_how_i_made_a_2d_game_using_python/","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":9}}

{"title":"Made a Python package for extracting color palettes from images","description":"So I made a color palette extractor Python package last year which extracts color palettes from images and stores them in JSON files. When I made the package, it was for the Unix-ricing community here on Reddit and I wasn\u2019t aware at that time that similar packages were already available or did something similar.\n\nAnyways, I never made a post here about the package. And since I\u2019ve recently reworked the codebase, I wanted to share about it with the Python community. This is my first time working with the Python language and also my first time publishing something I made as a whole package.\n\nA small 1 minute demonstration of the package being used:  \n[Package Example](https://imgur.com/a/jKjagVE)\n\nThe package is available through PyPI and GitHub, however I hope it\u2019s okay if I only post the link to it\u2019s PyPI homepage since I don\u2019t want my GitHub name to be attached to this post (the link to the source code as well as the GitHub home page is both in the ReadMe and the homepage button in the PyPI project details):  \n[PyPI package homepage](https://pypi.org/project/pypalex/)\n\nIf the GitHub link to the source code is a hard requirement, please let me know and I will change the link in this post to point to it\u2019s GitHub repo instead of PyPI!\n\nI ask that if you use the package please feel free to leave any kind of feedback, especially if it\u2019s constructive criticism!

I thought I'd save someone else some time.\n\n\nsubprocess.Popen([\"start\", \"cmd\", \"/k\", \"your_external_executable_path_here\", \"your_exe_params_here\"], shell=True]\n\nThis will launch the subprocess in a command prompt and will return to command prompt at the end of execution.
