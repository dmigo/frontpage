{"title":"Fine tune BERT for domain-specific information retrieval.","description":"Hi guys, I'm a little lost on how to start a little side project.\n\nSo I want to take a BERT model, fine tune it on additional information about a specific domain which it was not initially trained on and then it should be able to answer questions regarding that topic. The way I understand it, I would need to put an additional question answering head on top of the fine-tuned model, in order for it to be able to answer questions and not just put out \"random\", to my query related sentences. Is this thinking correct?\n\nI question this because all I find on the internet is fine tuning a model on qa- data, that is labeled dataset with questions and answers. My dataset on the otherhand consists on only text data, hence the title \"information retrieval\".\n\nThanks for your insights!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11sxkj0/fine_tune_bert_for_domainspecific_information/","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["reddit","languagetechnology","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":2}}

{"title":"Getting into PhD Program at 30","description":"Hi all,\n\nI am interested in peoples thoughts about the possibility of going for a phD. I was looking into information studies at the univeristy of maryland in college Park, but now I am realizing I could try for more places. Basically wherever.\n\nSo about me. Got a BS in Physics, did teo summers  of research through NSF program. Realized I did not like the idea of sitting in a lab all day. Then got a masters in education and taught Hs for 3 years.\n\nRealized that was horrible.\n\nNow, falling back on my previous research I was able to get a job at an FFRDC (R&amp;D center) ive been at for 3.5 years now.\n\nI started out with NLP, but now work mainly on data engineering tasks. I still really enjoy scraping, information extraction type tasks and have built lots of pipelines using a combination of regex and other things like NLP out of the box spacy models. \n\nHowever. I have been stagnating for a while now. As I started to apply to DE jobs I realize my true passion is solving very difficult information extraction problems.\n\nI just realized that I want to get a phD so I can solve interesting problems.\n\nWhere does one start? Again the Information Studies program seems really interesting as I am more interested in NLP IE applications. Part if me thinks this is not possible but I think that is not true.\n\nAnyways, how should I prepare for my lack of schooling in CS? Should I start polishing up my side projects? Shiuld I study for the GRE? Should I do all the above? \n\nAny guidance is appreciated. It may be relevant to add that for a year now I decided to quit drinking / went completely sober. I felt pretty lost in the direction of my life lately, but now it has suddenly become very clear this is what I want to do.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11s96bw/getting_into_phd_program_at_30/","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["reddit","languagetechnology","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":18}}

{"title":"How To Fine-tune LLaMA Models, Smaller Models With Performance Of GPT3","description":"Recently, the LLaMA models by Meta were released. What makes these models so exciting, is that despite being small enough to run on consumer hardware, popular metrics show that the models perform as well or better than GPT3 despite being over 10X smaller!\n\nThe reason for this increased performance seems to be due to a larger number of tokens being used for training.\n\nNow, following along with the video tutorial and open-source code, you can now fine-tune these powerful models on your own dataset to further increase the ability of these models!\n\n[https://youtu.be/d4Cnv\\_g3GiI](https://youtu.be/d4Cnv_g3GiI)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11ryg4d/how_to_finetune_llama_models_smaller_models_with/","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["reddit","languagetechnology","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}

{"title":"Why chatgpt needs reinforcement learning","description":"Hello everyone, I'm a newer for RL and I have some questions after watching the \"Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: From Zero to chatGPT\" course from HuggingFace. Why is RL necessary? Once we have obtained the Reward model(The reward model is just another neural network that is differentiable), why not directly use it as a loss term and maximize it? What are the benefits and significance of using RL? Is it because the decoder in GPT involves a multi-stage decision-making process? If I have a one-step generation model, such as a GAN in the image field, do I still need RL?","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11rwdx6/why_chatgpt_needs_reinforcement_learning/","created":"2023-03-15","tags":["reddit","languagetechnology","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":2}}
