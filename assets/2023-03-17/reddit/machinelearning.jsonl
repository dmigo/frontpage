{"title":"LLMs are getting much cheaper \u2014 business impact? [D]","description":"Saw this out of Stanford. Apologies if it\u2019s been shared here already. \n\n*We introduce Alpaca 7B, a model fine-tuned from the LLaMA 7B model on 52K instruction-following demonstrations. On our preliminary evaluation of single-turn instruction following, Alpaca behaves qualitatively similarly to OpenAI\u2019s text-davinci-003, while being surprisingly small and easy/cheap to reproduce (&lt;600$).*\n\nBasically, starting w an open source Meta 7B LLaMa model, they recruited GPT-3.5 to use for self-instruct training (as opposed to RLHF) and were able to produce a model that behaved similar to GPT-3.5. Amazingly, the process only took few weeks and $600 in compute cost.  \n\nAny thoughts on how such low cost to train/deploy LLMs could affect companies like AMD, Nvidia and Intel etc? This seems like new idiom of AI tech and trying to wrap my head around CPU/GPU demand implications given the apparent orders of magnitude training cost reduction. \n\nLink: https://crfm.stanford.edu/2023/03/13/alpaca.html","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11tenm7/llms_are_getting_much_cheaper_business_impact_d/","created":"2023-03-17","tags":["ml","machinelearning","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":49}}

With some of my fellows, we are watching what has been happening in the last couple of months with quite a shock and wonder as the community is throwing valuable feedback (for free) to a (closed source) company from all available online channels (e.g., Reddit, Twitter, Github, blogs), boosting their models (again for free).\n\nI should better note here that this is what they need to go from GPT-4 to v5, or GPTX (folks love X these days).\n\nThere are also valuable calls to action from the community. As a start, community can attempt to create an open initiative to organize all the feedback thrown to open or closed (e.g., GPT-4) conversational models/papers/products. One may argue this will make companies' work even easier, but if there is a resource to mine, it will be mined. Therefore creating a (legal) initiative may work in the favor of the community.\n\nWe should consider that conversational DL (maybe in the far future AI, not sure about that yet) becoming like the commercial aircraft industry where the only way to succeed is to fall and enforce what went wrong. Although the community is very excited now, folks may (probably will) get saturated, and the new companies and initiatives in the future may not get the same amount of feedback. \n\nThis may create a monopoly, so it can be a better idea now to discuss the options how we can unify these valuable resources.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/11szdo9/d_creating_an_open_platform_for_collecting/","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["ml","machinelearning","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":5}}
