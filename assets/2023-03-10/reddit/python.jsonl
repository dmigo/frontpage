{"title":"heyoka.py 0.21 - ODE integration wth LLVM, now supporting multiprecision","description":"Hello there!\n\nI posted here before about [heyoka.py](https://github.com/bluescarni/heyoka.py), our high-performance ODE integrator based on LLVM.\n\nWe recently released a new version supporting arbitrary-precision computations. This support is built on top of a multiprecision class exposed from C++ to Python, with full NumPy support. That is, this new datatype can be used as a native ``dtype`` in NumPy arrays. I believe this might be a first in the scientific Python ecosystem.\n\nHere is a tutorial introducing the new feature:\n\nhttps://bluescarni.github.io/heyoka.py/notebooks/arbitrary_precision.html\n\nThanks to the properties of the specific numerical integration method employed by heyoka.py (Taylor's method), multiprecision numerical integrations can be orders of magnitude faster than DifferentialEquations.jl, as shown in the benchmarks section here:\n\nhttps://bluescarni.github.io/heyoka/benchmarks.html#extended-and-arbitrary-precision\n\nThe latest version of heyoka.py also introduces a prebuilt ``pip`` wheel for Linux x86-64 (whereas previous versions had only ``conda`` packages):\n\n```\n$ pip install heyoka\n```\n\nPlease let me know if you have comments, questions, criticism, etc.!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11nj2g0/heyokapy_021_ode_integration_wth_llvm_now/","created":"2023-03-10","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}

{"title":"qStore - Youtube as file storage","description":"Okay, first and foremost, I want to say that I got inspired by GitHub: DvorakDwarf's [Infinite-Storage-Glitch](https://github.com/DvorakDwarf/Infinite-Storage-Glitch). So I decided to make my own proof of concept version in python3 instead of rust. I also wanted to use steganography but youtube's compression killed any and all hope I had. I have tried LSB, RGB, DCT, and Spacial Domain steganography and ALL work normally on their own...but all have failed when I upload the video to youtube and then download it.\n\nSo I decided to be a little clever and use QR codes. I modify one of many frames in the video with a QR code, and then re make the video and then it's ready to upload. One may wonder, \"well if it's in the QR code then the data can be easily obtained.\" Yes and No. Yes in terms of it's indeed a normal QR code and works how you'd expect it to work, and no in terms of the file data is encrypted using GCMlib (AES-GCM. KDF Argon2id) before being turned into the QR code. One can use any encryption method they want but I use GCMlib. (use at your own risk obviously).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[qStore](https://github.com/therealOri/qStore) also has its own database to keep track of what videos are what and the keys used to encrypt the file that is in the QR code. This database can also be locked and unlocked. (Like bitwarden). Just give it a key that was generated and then it's up to you on how you store it and keep it safe. (You can also use your own way of encrypting files if you wish, my methods are use at your own risk obviously.) You can add, remove, and view entries/records as well.\n\nThere's nothing really more to say about it as this project is still being worked on and I still really hope that eventually I can use actual steganography to embed a file into the videos. But for now, just QR codes.\n\nIf you or anyone you know would like to help out or even try it out/use my project then the link is below. &lt;3\n\nLink to github repo: [https://github.com/therealOri/qStore](https://github.com/therealOri/qStore)  \n\n\n  \n\n\n[qStore main menu](https://preview.redd.it/gqi2fnz01rma1.png?width=851&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=aa637f2bbf49ea9a040cd6ea0be48a808ed6028d)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11my1tz/qstore_youtube_as_file_storage/","created":"2023-03-09","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":3}}

{"title":"I made a Finance Database with over 300.000 tickers to make Investment Decisions easier","description":"It has been well over 2 years since I first introduced the database to this community, see [here](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase), and since then a lot changed so I felt like it is worth sharing about my package yet again and honestly, also to ask for a little bit of help.\n\nSo, within the investment universe there exists tens of thousands of companies (and even more when you include all exchanges). Identifying all of them and understanding in detail where they fit in the world is tough up to a point that it either requires you to pay a hefty fee to obtain this type of categorisation or do a massive amount of manual research. I found it a bit strange that this information was not publicly available while it is quite crucial for investment research. Therefore I got to work.\n\n**Insert the** [**FinanceDatabase**](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase)**.** This is a database of over 300.000 symbols (155k+ companies, 36k+ ETFs, 57k+ Funds, 3k+ Cryptocurrencies and more) that is fully categorised per country, industry, sector, category and more. It includes a package, written in Python and installable with \\`pip install financedatabase\\`, that gives access to the data with ease. You can obtain the entire dataset per asset class, search through it and filter based on specific options. Have a look at [this Notebook](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/blob/main/examples.ipynb) to have an idea what it is offering.\n\nA simple example of what it does in the following:\n\n    import financedatabase as fd\n    \n    # Initialize the Equities database\n    equities = fd.Equities()\n    \n    # Obtain all data available excluding international exchanges\n    equities.select()\n\nWhich returns the following DataFrame: https://preview.redd.it/5gmiej7pbjma1.png?width=1516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=faa84ca0e91107530f9845a5313ff79adc54ba6a\n\nBy default it hides non-US exchanges (since the ticker symbols work for most other programs) but that can be turned off with **equities.select(exclude\\_exchanges=False)** which returns 155.000 rows.\n\nThe database explicitly does not store up to date fundamental data. It tries to be as timeless as possible so that it doesn't become outdated fast. Because there are a variety of other ways, like FinancialModelingPrep, yFinance etc, to get this data there is no use in including this in the database.\n\nI've improved this database not only by increasing the amount of symbols (from 180k to 300k) but also:\n\n* Approximated the The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS\u00ae), a standard used for sectors and industries everywhere. Note that this was approximated and therefore no actual data is collected. Furthermore, not all categories are included.\n* Updated and removed tickers that either no longer exist or had outdated information.\n* Made the package itself object orientated making data collecting and searching much more efficient and logical. (shoutout to [Colin Delahunty](https://github.com/colin99d) for the help here too)\n* The database initially featured thousands of JSON files. At the time it made sense also given my rather novice background in programming. However, a much more efficient (and manageable way) is to work with CSV files. So instead, one CSV file per asset class.\n* Due to using CSV files, it becomes **really** easy to update accordingly.\n* To make loading data itself still quick, it automatically compresses the data so that loading in data is not slowed down by using a format that is more easy to update.\n* Updated the README, Contributing Guidelines and overal documentation.\n\nSo being an open source project and trying to maintain such a database is tough to do alone. While I strongly believe the database can stay relevant for a long period due to the fact that the majority of companies do not suddenly stop existing, some maintenance is needed. Therefore, with this post I would like to not only invite you to explore the database but also to see if you can improve it along the way. Please visit the [CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) that explains in detail how you can contribute. Just pointing out wrong or missing information is already very beneficial!\n\nHope this database is still just as useful as it was two years ago!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11lyyzb/i_made_a_finance_database_with_over_300000/","created":"2023-03-08","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":31}}

Scikit-learn offers a broadly useful suite of features for classifier models, but these are hard to use with Transformers.
