{"title":"Best GPUs for pretraining roBERTa-size LLMs with a $50K budget, 4x RTX A6000 v.s. 4x A6000 ADA v.s. 2x A100 80GB","description":"Hi folks,\n\nOur lab plans to purchase a server with some decent GPUs to perform some pertaining tasks for program codes. We won't work on very large LLM and we even may not try the T5 model. Currently, we want to first try the roBERTa model. We have a $50K budget. And it's our first time purchasing GPU servers.\n\nI did some preliminary study and found the suggested GPU is A6000 ADA which has 48 GB GPU memory, according to [https://timdettmers.com/2023/01/30/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/](https://timdettmers.com/2023/01/30/which-gpu-for-deep-learning/). Since our tasks require lots of GPU memory, we think a GPU with more than 32 GB will be good for us. So our alternative choices are RTX A6000 and A100 80GB HBM2 cards. \n\nBased on these, we got three server specs from Exxact ( [https://www.exxactcorp.com/TWS-115999024/configurator](https://www.exxactcorp.com/TWS-115999024/configurator)), (1) a $43K spec with 4  A6000 ADA cards, (2) a $32K spec with 4 RTX A6000 cards, and (3) a $41K spec with 2 A100 80GB cards. The other parts in the specs, e.g., CPU and RAM, are almost the same. I have attached the specs in screenshots.\n\nNow, I have some questions. \n\n1. A6000 ADA removed NVLink ([https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/rtx-a6000-ada-no-more-nv-link-even-on-pro-gpus/230874](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/rtx-a6000-ada-no-more-nv-link-even-on-pro-gpus/230874)) which is very important for performance boosting and GPU memory pooling. Does this mean it's a good choice to have multiple A6000 ADA cards on a server?\n2. A6000 ADA is a very new GPU improved from RTX A6000. But it has the NVLink, which means the server GPU memory can reach 48 \\* 4 GB when connecting 4 RTX A6000 cards. However, we are going to use the GPU server for several years. For IT products, it's always better to purchase the latest ones. Is that true for GPU cards? And A6000 ADA has more tensor and cuda cores than RTX A6000. \n3. For the A100 80GB spec, we can only have 2 cards wondering the budget. For the LLM pertaining, more cards usually mean more parallelism and faster training. Based on my study, A6000 ADA has comparable performance to A100 on DL benchmarks. Is this A100 80GB spec a good choice?\n4. Except for the ahead-mentioned specs, what else would you recommend for our pretraining tasks, especially for GPUs?\n\nThanks for your time! We really appreciate any suggestions.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/11vb220/best_gpus_for_pretraining_robertasize_llms_with_a/","created":"2023-03-19","tags":["deeplearning","ml","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":5}}

{"title":"Question on Attention","description":"Hello Everyone!\n\nI have a question about scoring in attention. In attention, you find the dot product between the query and the keys. From my understanding, the intuition is that we can use the inner product as the a mechanism to understand similarity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't think I fully understand this:\n\nLets say we have a query q\\_1 = \\[1, 1, 1\\]\n\nAnd we have two keys k\\_1=  \\[1, 1, 1\\] and k\\_2 = \\[100, 50, 100\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe dot-product for q\\_1 @ k\\_1 = 3 while the dot product for q\\_1 @ k\\_2 = 250\n\nSo in the soft-max, the value associated with k\\_2 will be weighted much higher, even though q\\_1 and k\\_1 were literally the same vector.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this would work if all the vectors were unit length (ie cosine similarity), but most examples I have seen online don't normalize by the magnitude of the vectors, but by sqrt{d} where d seems to be the number of elements?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf someone could explain where I am missing something, I would really appreciate it!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/11ugj0f/question_on_attention/","created":"2023-03-18","tags":["deeplearning","ml","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":7}}

I saw the very same concept before and I believe GPT-4 is capable of doing something similar. First, I have to say that I am familiar with the computer vision procedure. I did it [before](https://haghiri75.com/en/analyzing-components-of-an-electric-circuit-with-yolov5/) and I know using YOLO algorithms might be a good idea.\n\nAlso, I have no problems developing a \"Sketch to code\" program since I can pipe my results to another AI or code generator. But I also found [Uizard](http://uizard.io) which can turn your hand-drawn sketches into \"Design\".\n\nIt made some questions in my mind which are the following:\n\n1. Is there any language for design? Or it's just XML, HTML or SVG coded file?\n2. Is there any code/design generator which is capable of turning a simple design document (like *a page with a navbar*) to HTML or SVG? and **open source** of course!\n\nI will be thankful for your helps and comments.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/11ukow0/need_some_advice_for_my_idea_of_sketch_to_design/","created":"2023-03-18","tags":["deeplearning","ml","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":1}}
