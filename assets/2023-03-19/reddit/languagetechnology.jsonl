{"title":"Choosing Non-Linear vs Linear","description":"Hello all,\n\nIs there a process for deciding whether to use a Non-Linear or Linear text classifier? From what I have been reading, it seems like people develop scatter plots from their data points to see if their data is linearly separable. \nDo people do this with text data? What does everyone do to evaluate their choice of model?\n\nThanks!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11uyz56/choosing_nonlinear_vs_linear/","created":"2023-03-18","tags":["reddit","languagetechnology","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}
{"title":"Wanna team-up for Quantum NLP projects?","description":"I recently started reading about Quantum NLP. A very experimental and new field in Natural Language Processing. There are only a handful or research papers out there to aid in the knowledge of Quantum NLP, even universities such as MIT, Harvard and Stanford aren't capable or fully understand Quantum NLP yet. Only a few Quantum Computing research labs have the surface-intermediate understanding of Quantum NLP such as Cambridge Quantum.   \n\n\nI have read some of the most recent and important Quantum NLP papers and used **lambeq the only python library capable enough to do Quantum NLP.** Fast forward, I have implemented a basic Quantum NLP project where I classify sentences using Quantum NLP. \n\nI couldn't find many people who are interested in Quantum NLP, that's why, I was looking forward if someone is interested in Quantum NLP in this thread and has previous experience working with NLP itself then we can make a small team and study more advanced topics on Quantum NLP and do cool projects in our pastime. \n\n**GitHub repo link:** [https://github.com/sleepingcat4/Quantum-NLP](https://github.com/sleepingcat4/Quantum-NLP)  \n\n\nIf you're interested in teaming-up, kindly send me a message on **reddit or discord: sleeping\\_cat4#8182**","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11uia4r/wanna_teamup_for_quantum_nlp_projects/","created":"2023-03-18","tags":["reddit","languagetechnology","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":16}}

{"title":"New NLP Game Design potentials","description":"Hello I wanted to share some ideas! I believe some of these ideas to be legit avenues for making games with natural language processing, enabled by the power of GPT-4, and I really want to inspire more people down the line! Here are some apps you could make with the openAI API that leverage a whole new degree of responsiveness:  \n\n\n1. A card game where combat is settled by the names of the cards rather than descriptions or card text, using brief but accurate battle simulations! Pair nouns and adjectives, or even fuse cards to make novel new concepts! Who wins, Saitama or Goku? It takes on a whole new level of fairness and intuition when you let the AI take control!\n2. API calls could be used to procedurally generate enemies or catchable monsters in a roguelike! You could provide an example of a json stat sheet and go from there\n3. Considering json, you could (maybe) create a fighting game with MUGEN that merges calls between openai and an art generator, and create the ultimate platform fighter where players type in the name of their character instead of choosing from a select screen! (although generating move sprites is likely gatekept by a few things still....)  \n\n\nThank you for reading! please considering sharing some of these ideas or trying them out yourself, especially the first one I think it quite accessible. Imagine a deck building game where your card database list is the dictionary :)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11u7lt9/new_nlp_game_design_potentials/","created":"2023-03-17","tags":["reddit","languagetechnology","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}

{"title":"Fine tune BERT for domain-specific information retrieval.","description":"Hi guys, I'm a little lost on how to start a little side project.\n\nSo I want to take a BERT model, fine tune it on additional information about a specific domain which it was not initially trained on and then it should be able to answer questions regarding that topic. The way I understand it, I would need to put an additional question answering head on top of the fine-tuned model, in order for it to be able to answer questions and not just put out \"random\", to my query related sentences. Is this thinking correct?\n\nI question this because all I find on the internet is fine tuning a model on qa- data, that is labeled dataset with questions and answers. My dataset on the otherhand consists on only text data, hence the title \"information retrieval\".\n\nThanks for your insights!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/11sxkj0/fine_tune_bert_for_domainspecific_information/","created":"2023-03-16","tags":["reddit","languagetechnology","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":8}}
