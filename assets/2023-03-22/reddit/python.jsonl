{"title":"How do you decide to use a Python Package","description":"Hey guys,\n\nso I was wondering how do you decide on using a Python package? Of course there is the obvious answer that you chose a package based on functionality that you need (Pytorch for neural networks, requests for well... requests, etc.).\n\nThere are though in my eyes other factors that are important, especially in professional development and that is both safety of the package and also quality of the package. So my question is how do you judge those two parameters? Do you fly over the source code? Do you look at test coverage? Do you check for documentation before installing or are there any resources that provide insights into different packages? \n\nThanks in advance for your answers!","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11xfo9c/how_do_you_decide_to_use_a_python_package/","created":"2023-03-21","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":53}}

{"title":"How to check if pip package is malicious","description":"I'm looking for some tips on what to look for when evaluating a pip package for malicious code.    \nHere is an actual example I recently went through:\n\nThere is a fairly known pip package called **Cython**: [https://pypi.org/project/Cython/](https://pypi.org/project/Cython/).   \nAt the same time there is a lesser known package very similarly called **cPython**: [https://pypi.org/project/cPython/](https://pypi.org/project/cPython/)^1\n\nIt's easy to mistype:\n`pip install cpython`\ninstead of:\n`pip install cython`\n\nSince pip install executes code from the package itself I thought it would be useful to investigate what this package contains so went through the following steps:\n\n1. Went to project homepage under pypi.org https://pypi.org/project/cPython/ and downloaded the latest package version since I'm assuming this is what pip install fetches if no version is provided. The latest version seems to be 0.0.6 under Downloads: https://pypi.org/project/cPython/#files\n2. Uncompressed the file, it's a tar.gz\n3. Checked the following files:\n    1. setup.py : no suspicious code at first sight. Also looked at dependencies (install_requires) and got 2: pymongo and requests, which are well known packages\n    2. cPython.py in subdirectory cPython: I'm assuming this file is not executed by pip install but I'm not sure if the imports are not resolved, it seems there are more dependencies in this file than listed under setup.py, but none triggers any concerns.\n    3. __init__.py in same subdirectory cPython: empty, similar comment to above.\n\nIt seems this particular package does not distribute binary components so this makes reviewing easier.\n\nWould you think these kind of checks are sufficient or can there be some more hidden traps one can miss even on a simple package as in this example?\n\n\n^1 I should note that at the time of this writing there is no information to assume that malicious code is delivered through the cPython package, although it's not very clear why the author went with this name for what seems to be just a wrapper script.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11xj3ua/how_to_check_if_pip_package_is_malicious/","created":"2023-03-21","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":4}}
{"title":"Going to fail an Exam because I wasn't prepared","description":"I feel rather demoralized right now.\n\nI've been studying pretty good all semester in my Python class. I've been reading each chapter in the text book, watching the videos, and doing the assignments to a T. Yet, when I entered into the Midterm Exam, I felt WAY under prepared. I don't feel like I was taught anything.\n\nThis is a course about Python in a program called ArcGIS Pro. First assignment was just introduction. Second was an introduction to IDLE (no scripting yet). The third was towards a little bit of model building and then a tiny bit of scripting. Now we're JUST being introduced to scripting and actually running something.\n\nThe Midterm Exam was way more than \"here a script, run it and see what happens.\" It was \"I want you to create a buffer utilizing a list of four numbers that I'm going to give you and you're going to use a function that I never taught you how to use.\"\n\nHow the hell am I supposed to create a script from my head when I just started learning how to script a few days ago?\n\nMy biggest fear is finding out that other students were able to do this and I'm just a moron.\n\nI thought I was doing well and learning here and there. Now I don't think so.\n\nSorry if this doesn't belong here. I figured this place would be good as any to vent and have people understand what I'm talking about.

{"title":"[ZnFlow] Play around with Graphs","description":"I wrote a small package [ZnFlow](https://github.com/zincware/ZnFlow) ``pip install znflow`` that allows you to build computational graphs based on functions and/or classes.

The graph will only be executed when you call ``graph.run()``.\n\nHere is a small example:\n\n```python\nimport znflow\nimport dataclasses\n\n@znflow.nodify\ndef compute_mean(x, y):\n    return (x + y) / 2\n\n@dataclasses.dataclass\nclass ComputeMean(znflow.Node):\n    x: float\n    y: float\n    \n    results: float = None\n    \n    def run(self):\n        self.results = (self.x + self.y) / 2\n        \nwith znflow.DiGraph() as graph:\n    n1 = ComputeMean(2, 8)\n    n2 = compute_mean(13, 7)\n    # connecting classes and functions to a Node\n    n3 = ComputeMean(n1.results, n2) \n    \ngraph.run()\nprint(n3.results)\n# &gt;&gt;&gt; 7.5\n```\n\nSo far there is no parallel execution and this is ment as a playground for writing graphs.

This is the same process I will use to add support for more algorithms. Components of the same type can be hot-swapped for each other.\n* Extensible components can be used directly for developing your own applications, not just creating a quick proof of concept in the terminal.\n\nWould appreciate any constructive and respectful feedback.\n\nEDIT:\n\n\\- formatting","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11xm82u/chattoolkit_an_extensible_package_for_creating/","created":"2023-03-21","tags":["python","reddit"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}
