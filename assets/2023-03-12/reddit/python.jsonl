For example, I automated the process of requesting an imagined image of what buildings might look like if humans settled on Mars from ChatGPT and then having a picture drawn based on the results.\n\nI've attached pictures drawn by Karlo API from Kakao and DALL-E from OpenAI. The impressive thing is that the results of the different AIs' interpretations based on ChatGPT's imaginative input are unique and meaningful. As the shared link is written in Korean, I recommend using a Chrome extension to translate the content into English for those who are interested.\n\n[ The image of a human settlement on Mars drawn by DALL-E. ](https://preview.redd.it/58p82nmva9na1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2ca4f49b746141321ce367712456c935af3f1fda)\n\n[ The image of a human settlement on Mars drawn by Karlo ](https://preview.redd.it/ohjqtolwa9na1.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=9e30b01af6124a72927da7fe3317bae26dd7290f)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11p7yrq/using_chatgpt_api_in_python_feat_dalle_karlo/","created":"2023-03-12","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}

{"title":"PSA: conda-libmamba-solver can cut two hours off of your Anaconda install, but has only 47 GitHub stars. It deserves more praise.","description":"If you've dealt with Conda for data science, or just because it's a cool environment, you know the algorithm Conda uses to solve library conflicts is not great. Trying to add 6 packages for example can take 300 seconds to solve. That's just normal. A bit more complex environment, and you can take 20 minutes. If you misstep in just the wrong way however, you can easily take **3+ hours** for the algorithm to figure out what's compatible. Mamba, an alternative to Conda, is a known solution but it just isn't the same. Lots of people would rather keep using Conda. Well... apparently it's fairly straightforward to *fix Conda*:\n\n    conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver\n\nThen you just add the flag `--solver=libmamba` to each command you want to use it with thereafter and compare the difference. In my case it took a 2 hour 17 minute install down to 16 minutes or so.\n\nThis is also an interesting lesson in software design. Conda tried to roll their own solver that runs on a single core in pure Python. The alternative a proven multi-core C++ library.\n\nHopefully someone finds this useful.\n\n[Link to relevant GitHub.

{"title":"Near-Earth Objects &amp; Asteroids: Some space science","description":"Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to write this small post since a few weeks, but somehow lost track due to new videos and coding I am currently doing in parallel.\n\nAnyway. In the last couple of weeks I created a small Python based project series on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). Quick intro: NEOs are objects that approach the Sun within a distance of max. 1.3 AU. 1.0 AU corresponds to the average distance between Earth and Sun (around 150 Million km).\n\nYou may hear sometimes of these objects in the media when an asteroid is approaching us, is having a close flyby, or is detected before it vanishes while disintegrating in the night sky, [like this one](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64621721).\n\n*But how many objects are out there? Where are they and how do they \"travel\" around the Sun? Are they bright? If yes, how bright? How can we compute their brightness? Can we also model a theoretical distribution of NEOs to get an understanding where we have \"to look at\"? And what kind of telescopes are needed?*\n\nThese are ... a lot of questions. And in my 16 parts tutorial I try to tackle all questions as thoroughly as possible. If you are interested in getting an understanding how this particular topic is handled in \"space science\", feel free to take a look at my GitHub repository and the corresponding explanatory videos.\n\nSpace Science is approachable; and there are tons of libraries and Open Access data for Python. I try to gather my academic knowledge and create these tutorials to support students, free-time coders and everyone, who is into Python and astronomy.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nThomas\n\n[GitHub Link](https://github.com/ThomasAlbin/Astroniz-YT-Tutorials/tree/main/%5BProject%5D-Near-Earth-Objects)\n\n[YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVyFqVuuM6g&amp;list=PLNvIBWkEdZ2hL5be8mQdpTU3BjhKIhD6L)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11or701/nearearth_objects_asteroids_some_space_science/","created":"2023-03-11","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}
