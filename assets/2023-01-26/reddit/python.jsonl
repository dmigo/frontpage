{"title":"Heat map representation of chess moves","description":"  \n\n\n[knight, bishop, queen, rooks , pawns, king, respectively, from move 20 to 40](https://preview.redd.it/8k11a54ondea1.png?width=6248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=0cf74025d116530ee078ba11ef898b89e66dd81c)\n\nA while ago I made a tool in python that allows you to calculate the heat map representation of a player games pgn file, and more recently I've been changing it from being a pile of code to an actualize usable tool.  \nThere is the default heat map that shows where each piece move the most to.  \nThere's few option that can be applied to any heat map, like: filter to a certain move or to filter the game from a x move to a y move and make their heat map representation.  \nI also made a way to find the differences between moves from 2 different players. My idea was to find which moves does a strong player make that a weaker one doesn't. Unfortunately even by limiting the search for a certain amount of moves I concluded nothing from the heat maps because the results are very opening dependent.  \nI made, as well, a way to see where each piece captures others. I found this feature particularly interesting when I apply the filter option to look between certain move intervals and I can see, for example, where a each piece captures most in openings, middle games and endgames.\n\nThis project is far from finished but [here it is](https://github.com/jotaalvim/chess-heatmaps), I have multiple example of heat maps in there, feel free to have a look and to to give suggestions.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/10lq7z7/heat_map_representation_of_chess_moves/","created":"2023-01-26","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":2}}
{"title":"Interactive plots","description":"I've been using seaborn to generate visualizations for various datasets and can say I absolutely love it.  There's really very few things I cannot visualize with it.  I've recently had a need for interactive visualizations, like a dashboard.  I went pretty far into the usage of dash and plotly.  It's ok, but is very awkward in how it handles cascading/dependent drop downs and it's also annoying I cannot re-use my seaborn code to generate plots, so I basically re-write everything.  What I'm wondering is if there's a way to utilize seaborn code to generate visualizations that can be interacted with?  The closest thing I've found (or read about) is creating a jupyter notebook and embedding that as a web page which can have sliders, buttons, etc... through ipywidgets.  Just reaching out to this community to see if I'm missing something or if anyone has had any experience with ipywidgets or other similar solutions.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/10lq9h0/interactive_plots/","created":"2023-01-26","tags":["reddit","python"],"meta":{"num_comments":8}}

However, if the source code for the first script has not changed, it would not need to be run again. Using make dependencies that works quite nicely. However, what is quite annoying in make is that there seems to be no nice way of passing command line arguments to a script. Therefore, I am looking for an alternative.
