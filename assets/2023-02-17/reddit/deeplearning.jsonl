I selected this one because it seems a good architecture and was easy to implemented it in Javascript, where you wont find it.\n\nThe first 16 layers use pretrained weights taken from the [Keras creator GH page](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models).\n\nI have trained the out putlayers it with [Caltech101 datasets](https://data.caltech.edu/records/mzrjq-6wc02) airplanes (800), faces (400), stop signs (60) etc.\n\nIt predicts reasonably well with images of the same dataset not seen before by the model.\n\nYet for any new image (any picture with a face that I have in the laptop) the predictions are terrible.\n\nAfter running out of ideas I am reaching out for some help.

This is important because the net should not be more than 100MB large, which is the max can tolerate for now, until things are less complex to understand.\n\nI have seen some of these models have mobile versions, or lite versions, but I wonder if there are a few \"go-tos\" because implementing the parsing of the output will take time, so I'd prefer to start with a somewhat solid model.\n\n At the moment, I am planning to do it with Python Keras, such that it can be saved as a Layers Model.","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/113u8u8/candidates_for_lightweight_object_detector_nns/","created":"2023-02-16","tags":["deeplearning","reddit","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":6}}

{"title":"Finding a Data Labeling Methodology for Companies","description":"Hey everyone, I recently needed to implement a data labeling workflow in my company and found a methodology that worked well for us. We took a few steps to begin the data labeling process as follows:\n\nWe defined the ontology of our labels by preparing a handbook to describe our use case and requirements and determined the labels we needed.\n\nThen, we created an instruction, prepared the required infrastructure, set up the labeling tools, and started labeling the data using provided data labeling tools.\n\nFinally, we will assess the quality of the labels using data assessment methods, most probably with active learning.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about this methodology, you can check out this post on [data labeling](https://galliot.us/blog/data-labeling-approaches-challenges-tools/). It also goes into more detail about data labeling approaches, challenges, and solutions and offers some available data labeling tools.

LangChain is one of the most exciting emerging tools in the space of working with LLMs. LangChain provides a set of abstractions around flowing Language Models Calls to one another and connecting them to external tool use. As Bob describes, there was a lot of interest in hooking these LLMs up with Google Search to connect it to knowledge and reduce hallucination -- so why not hook it up to your own data enabled with Semantic Search through Weaviate!! Harrison and Bob are both incredibly knowledgeable about this emerging area of Deep Learning technology and I really enjoyed this conversation!\n\nCheck out the podcast here!  \n[https://youtu.be/lhby7Ql7hbk](https://youtu.be/lhby7Ql7hbk)","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/comments/11302xl/langchain_x_weaviate_new_weaviate_podcast/","created":"2023-02-15","tags":["deeplearning","reddit","ml"],"meta":{"num_comments":0}}
