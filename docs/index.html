                  While the availability of large and diverse datasets has contributed to significant breakthroughs in autonomous driving and indoor applications, forestry applications are still lagging behind and new forest datasets would most certainly contribute to achieving significant progress in the development of data-driven methods for forest-like scenarios. This paper introduces a forest dataset called \textit{FinnWoodlands}, which consists of RGB stereo images, point clouds, and sparse depth maps, as well as ground truth manual annotations for semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. \textit{FinnWoodlands} comprises a total of 4226 objects manually annotated, out of which 2562 objects (60.6\%) correspond to tree trunks classified into three different instance categories, namely "Spruce Tree", "Birch Tree", and "Pine Tree". Besides tree trunks, we also annotated "Obstacles" objects as instances as well as the semantic stuff classes "Lake", "Ground", and "Track". Our dataset can be used in forestry applications where a holistic representation of the environment is relevant. We provide an initial benchmark using three models for instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and depth completion, and illustrate the challenges that such unstructured scenarios introduce.

                  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly being used to automate segmentation of organs-at-risk in radiotherapy. Since large sets of highly curated data are scarce, we investigated how much data is required to train accurate and robust head and neck auto-segmentation models. For this, an established 3D CNN was trained from scratch with different sized datasets (25-1000 scans) to segment the brainstem, parotid glands and spinal cord in CTs. Additionally, we evaluated multiple ensemble techniques to improve the performance of these models. The segmentations improved with training set size up to 250 scans and the ensemble methods significantly improved performance for all organs. The impact of the ensemble methods was most notable in the smallest datasets, demonstrating their potential for use in cases where large training datasets are difficult to obtain.

                  Language model probing is often used to test specific capabilities of these models. However, conclusions from such studies may be limited when the probing benchmarks are small and lack statistical power. In this work, we introduce new, larger datasets for negation (NEG-1500-SIMP) and role reversal (ROLE-1500) inspired by psycholinguistic studies. We dramatically extend existing NEG-136 and ROLE-88 benchmarks using GPT3, increasing their size from 18 and 44 sentence pairs to 750 each. We also create another version of extended negation dataset (NEG-1500-SIMP-TEMP), created using template-based generation. It consists of 770 sentence pairs. We evaluate 22 models on the extended datasets, seeing model performance dip 20-57% compared to the original smaller benchmarks. We observe high levels of negation sensitivity in models like BERT and ALBERT demonstrating that previous findings might have been skewed due to smaller test sets. Finally, we observe that while GPT3 has generated all the examples in ROLE-1500 is only able to solve 24.6% of them during probing.

                  We study human pose estimation in extremely low-light images. This task is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting real low-light images with accurate labels, and severely corrupted inputs that degrade prediction quality significantly. To address the first issue, we develop a dedicated camera system and build a new dataset of real low-light images with accurate pose labels. Thanks to our camera system, each low-light image in our dataset is coupled with an aligned well-lit image, which enables accurate pose labeling and is used as privileged information during training. We also propose a new model and a new training strategy that fully exploit the privileged information to learn representation insensitive to lighting conditions. Our method demonstrates outstanding performance on real extremely low light images, and extensive analyses validate that both of our model and dataset contribute to the success.

                  Instrument playing technique (IPT) is a key element of musical presentation. However, most of the existing works for IPT detection only concern monophonic music signals, yet little has been done to detect IPTs in polyphonic instrumental solo pieces with overlapping IPTs or mixed IPTs. In this paper, we formulate it as a frame-level multi-label classification problem and apply it to Guzheng, a Chinese plucked string instrument. We create a new dataset, Guzheng\_Tech99, containing Guzheng recordings and onset, offset, pitch, IPT annotations of each note. Because different IPTs vary a lot in their lengths, we propose a new method to solve this problem using multi-scale network and self-attention. The multi-scale network extracts features from different scales, and the self-attention mechanism applied to the feature maps at the coarsest scale further enhances the long-range feature extraction. Our approach outperforms existing works by a large margin, indicating its effectiveness in IPT detection.

                  Machine learning algorithms, especially Neural Networks (NNs), are a valuable tool used to approximate non-linear relationships, like the AC-Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF), with considerable accuracy -- and achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude when deployed for use. Often in power systems literature, the NNs are trained with a fixed dataset generated prior to the training process. In this paper, we show that adapting the NN training dataset during training can improve the NN performance and substantially reduce its worst-case violations. This paper proposes an algorithm that identifies and enriches the training dataset with critical datapoints that reduce the worst-case violations and deliver a neural network with improved worst-case performance guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in four test power systems, ranging from 39-buses to 162-buses.

                  Recent work on database application development platforms has sought to include a declarative formulation of a conceptual data model in the application code, using annotations or attributes. Some recent work has used metadata to include the details of such formulations in the physical database, and this approach brings significant advantages in that the model can be enforced across a range of applications for a single database. In previous work, we have discussed the advantages for enterprise integration of typed graph data models (TGM), which can play a similar role in graphical databases, leveraging the existing support for the unified modelling language UML. Ideally, the integration of systems designed with different models, for example, graphical and relational database, should also be supported. In this work, we implement this approach, using metadata in a relational database management system (DBMS).

                  The goal of data-free meta-learning is to learn useful prior knowledge from a collection of pre-trained models without accessing their training data. However, existing works only solve the problem in parameter space, which (i) ignore the fruitful data knowledge contained in the pre-trained models; (ii) can not scale to large-scale pre-trained models; (iii) can only meta-learn pre-trained models with the same network architecture. To address those issues, we propose a unified framework, dubbed PURER, which contains: (1) ePisode cUrriculum inveRsion (ECI) during data-free meta training; and (2) invErsion calibRation following inner loop (ICFIL) during meta testing. During meta training, we propose ECI to perform pseudo episode training for learning to adapt fast to new unseen tasks. Specifically, we progressively synthesize a sequence of pseudo episodes by distilling the training data from each pre-trained model. The ECI adaptively increases the difficulty level of pseudo episodes according to the real-time feedback of the meta model. We formulate the optimization process of meta training with ECI as an adversarial form in an end-to-end manner. During meta testing, we further propose a simple plug-and-play supplement-ICFIL-only used during meta testing to narrow the gap between meta training and meta testing task distribution. Extensive experiments in various real-world scenarios show the superior performance of ours.

                  Recently, many video enhancement methods have been proposed to improve video quality from different aspects such as color, brightness, contrast, and stability. Therefore, how to evaluate the quality of the enhanced video in a way consistent with human visual perception is an important research topic. However, most video quality assessment methods mainly calculate video quality by estimating the distortion degrees of videos from an overall perspective. Few researchers have specifically proposed a video quality assessment method for video enhancement, and there is also no comprehensive video quality assessment dataset available in public. Therefore, we construct a Video quality assessment dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement (VDPVE) in this paper. The VDPVE has 1211 videos with different enhancements, which can be divided into three sub-datasets: the first sub-dataset has 600 videos with color, brightness, and contrast enhancements; the second sub-dataset has 310 videos with deblurring; and the third sub-dataset has 301 deshaked videos. We invited 21 subjects (20 valid subjects) to rate all enhanced videos in the VDPVE. After normalizing and averaging the subjective opinion scores, the mean opinion score of each video can be obtained. Furthermore, we split the VDPVE into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, and verify the performance of several state-of-the-art video quality assessment methods on the test set of the VDPVE.

                  The QM9 dataset [Scientific Data, Vol. 1, 140022 (2014)] became a standard dataset to benchmark machine learning methods, especially on molecular graphs. It contains geometries as well as multiple computed molecular properties of 133,885 compounds at B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory, including frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) energies. However, the accuracy of HOMO/LUMO predictions from density functional theory, including hybrid methods such as B3LYP, is limited for many applications. In contrast, the GW method significantly improves HOMO/LUMO prediction accuracy, with mean unsigned errors in the GW100 benchmark dataset of 100 meV. In this work, we present a new dataset of HOMO/LUMO energies for the QM9 compounds, computed using the GW method. This database may serve as a benchmark of HOMO/LUMO prediction, delta-learning, and transfer learning, particularly for larger molecules where GW is the most accurate but still numerically feasible method. We expect this dataset to enable the development of more accurate machine learning models for predicting molecular properties

The aim is to provide the community interested in data-assimilation and/or Lagrangian-properties of turbulence a new testing-ground made of roughly 300K different Lagrangian trajectories. TURB-Lagr data are influenced by the strong non-Gaussian fluctuations characteristic of turbulence and by the rough and non differentiable fields.

                  Vision research showed remarkable success in understanding our world, propelled by datasets of images and videos. Sensor data from radar, LiDAR and cameras supports research in robotics and autonomous driving for at least a decade. However, while visual sensors may fail in some conditions, sound has recently shown potential to complement sensor data. Simulated room impulse responses (RIR) in 3D apartment-models became a benchmark dataset for the community, fostering a range of audiovisual research. In simulation, depth is predictable from sound, by learning bat-like perception with a neural network. Concurrently, the same was achieved in reality by using RGB-D images and echoes of chirping sounds. Biomimicking bat perception is an exciting new direction but needs dedicated datasets to explore the potential. Therefore, we collected the BatVision dataset to provide large-scale echoes in complex real-world scenes to the community. We equipped a robot with a speaker to emit chirps and a binaural microphone to record their echoes. Synchronized RGB-D images from the same perspective provide visual labels of traversed spaces. We sampled modern US office spaces to historic French university grounds, indoor and outdoor with large architectural variety. This dataset will allow research on robot echolocation, general audio-visual tasks and sound phaenomena unavailable in simulated data. We show promising results for audio-only depth prediction and show how state-of-the-art work developed for simulated data can also succeed on our dataset. The data can be downloaded at https://github.com/AmandineBtto/Batvision-Dataset

                  Protein language models (pLMs), pre-trained via causal language modeling on protein sequences, have been a promising tool for protein sequence design. In real-world protein engineering, there are many cases where the amino acids in the middle of a protein sequence are optimized while maintaining other residues. Unfortunately, because of the left-to-right nature of pLMs, existing pLMs modify suffix residues by prompting prefix residues, which are insufficient for the infilling task that considers the whole surrounding context. To find the more effective pLMs for protein engineering, we design a new benchmark, Secondary structureE InFilling rEcoveRy, SEIFER, which approximates infilling sequence design scenarios. With the evaluation of existing models on the benchmark, we reveal the weakness of existing language models and show that language models trained via fill-in-middle transformation, called ProtFIM, are more appropriate for protein engineering. Also, we prove that ProtFIM generates protein sequences with decent protein representations through exhaustive experiments and visualizations.

                  A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), Studio.ai, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.

                  Text-to-image generative models have recently exploded in popularity and accessibility. Yet so far, use of these models in creative tasks that bridge the 2D digital world and the creation of physical artefacts has been understudied. We conduct a pilot study to investigate if and how text-to-image models can be used to assist in upstream tasks within the creative process, such as ideation and visualization, prior to a sculpture-making activity. Thirty participants selected sculpture-making materials and generated three images using the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator, each with text prompts of their choice, with the aim of informing and then creating a physical sculpture. The majority of participants (23/30) reported that the generated images informed their sculptures, and 28/30 reported interest in using text-to-image models to help them in a creative task in the future. We identify several prompt engineering strategies and find that a participant's prompting strategy relates to their stage in the creative process. We discuss how our findings can inform support for users at different stages of the design process and for using text-to-image models for physical artefact design.

                  Extraction of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and their semantic relations from unstructured text (e.g., Stack Overflow) is a fundamental work for software engineering tasks (e.g., API recommendation). However, existing approaches are rule-based and sequence-labeling based. They must manually enumerate the rules or label data for a wide range of sentence patterns, which involves a significant amount of labor overhead and is exacerbated by morphological and common-word ambiguity. In contrast to matching or labeling API entities and relations, this paper formulates heterogeneous API extraction and API relation extraction task as a sequence-to-sequence generation task, and proposes AERJE, an API entity-relation joint extraction model based on the large pre-trained language model. After training on a small number of ambiguous but correctly labeled data, AERJE builds a multi-task architecture that extracts API entities and relations from unstructured text using dynamic prompts. We systematically evaluate AERJE on a set of long and ambiguous sentences from Stack Overflow. The experimental results show that AERJE achieves high accuracy and discrimination ability in API entity-relation joint extraction, even with zero or few-shot fine-tuning.

                  Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to classify sensory time series into different activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare, human computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition performance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g., "open door" and "open fridge", "walk upstairs" and "walk downstairs". Through some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning activities into learning shared tokens ("open", "walk"), which is easier than learning the joint distribution ("open fridge", "walk upstairs") and helps transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated method, using OpenAI's ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects. Extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show better performance in the long-tail activity distribution settings and few-shot settings.

                  Nearly all jurisdictions in the United States require a professional license exam, commonly referred to as "the Bar Exam," as a precondition for law practice. To even sit for the exam, most jurisdictions require that an applicant completes at least seven years of post-secondary education, including three years at an accredited law school. In addition, most test-takers also undergo weeks to months of further, exam-specific preparation. Despite this significant investment of time and capital, approximately one in five test-takers still score under the rate required to pass the exam on their first try. In the face of a complex task that requires such depth of knowledge, what, then, should we expect of the state of the art in "AI?" In this research, we document our experimental evaluation of the performance of OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` model, often-referred to as GPT-3.5, on the multistate multiple choice (MBE) section of the exam. While we find no benefit in fine-tuning over GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance at the scale of our training data, we do find that hyperparameter optimization and prompt engineering positively impacted GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance. For best prompt and parameters, GPT-3.5 achieves a headline correct rate of 50.3% on a complete NCBE MBE practice exam, significantly in excess of the 25% baseline guessing rate, and performs at a passing rate for both Evidence and Torts. GPT-3.5's ranking of responses is also highly-correlated with correctness; its top two and top three choices are correct 71% and 88% of the time, respectively, indicating very strong non-entailment performance. While our ability to interpret these results is limited by nascent scientific understanding of LLMs and the proprietary nature of GPT, we believe that these results strongly suggest that an LLM will pass the MBE component of the Bar Exam in the near future.

                  Despite a generally accepted framework for describing the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglows, the nature of the compact object at the central engine and the mechanism behind the prompt emission remain debated. The striped jet model is a promising venue to connect the various GRB stages since it gives a robust prediction for the relation of jet bulk acceleration, magnetization and dissipation profile as a function of distance. Here, we use the constraints of the magnetization and bulk Lorentz of the jet flow at the large scales where the jet starts interacting with the ambient gas in a large sample of bursts to (i) test the striped jet model for the GRB flow and (ii) study its predictions for the prompt emission and the constraints on the nature of the central engine. We find that the peak of the photospheric component of the emission predicted by the model is in agreement with the observed prompt emission spectra in the majority of the bursts in our sample, with a radiative efficiency of about 10 per cent. Furthermore, we adopt two different approaches to correlate the peak energies of the bursts with the type of central engine to find that more bursts are compatible with a neutron star central engine compared to a black hole one. Lastly, we conclude that the model favors broader distribution of stripe length-scales which results in a more gradual dissipation profile in comparison to the case where the jet stripes are characterized by a single length-scale.

                  Recent methods demonstrate that data augmentation using counterfactual knowledge can teach models the causal structure of a task, leading to robust and generalizable models. However, such counterfactual data often has a limited scale and diversity if crowdsourced and is computationally expensive to extend to new perturbation types if generated using supervised methods. To address this, we introduce a new framework called DISCO for automatically generating high-quality counterfactual data at scale. DISCO engineers prompts to generate phrasal perturbations with a large general language model. Then, a task-specific teacher model filters the generation to distill high-quality counterfactual data. We show that learning with this counterfactual data yields a comparatively small student model that is 6% (absolute) more robust and generalizes 5% better across distributions than baselines on various challenging evaluations. This model is also 15% more sensitive in differentiating original and counterfactual examples, on three evaluation sets written by human workers and via human-AI collaboration.

                Evidence of high latitude emission in the prompt phase of GRBs: How far from the central engine are the GRBs produced?

                  The physical mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains elusive. One of the difficulties in nailing down their physical mechanism comes from the fact that there has been no clear observational evidence on how far from the central engine the prompt gamma-rays of GRBs are emitted while the competing physical mechanisms predict different characteristic distances. Here we present a simple study addressing this question by making use of the "high-latitude emission" (HLE). We show that our detailed numerical modeling exhibits a clear signature of HLE in the decaying phase of "broad pulses" of GRBs. We show that the HLE can emerge as a prominent spectral break in $F_{\nu}$ spectra and dominate the peak of $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectra even while the "line-of-sight emission" (LoSE) is still ongoing, hence providing a new view of HLE emergence. We remark that this "HLE break" could be hidden in some broad pulses, depending on the proximity between the peak energies of the LoSE and the HLE. Also, we present three examples of Fermi-GBM GRBs with broad pulses that exhibit the HLE signature. We show that their gamma-ray emitting region should be located at $\sim 10^{16}$ cm from the central engine, which disfavors the photosphere models and small-radii internal shock models but favors magnetic dissipation models with a large emission radius.

                  Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and Codex, now enable software developers to generate code based on a natural language prompt. Within computer science education, researchers are exploring the potential for LLMs to generate code explanations and programming assignments using carefully crafted prompts. These advances may enable students to interact with code in new ways while helping instructors scale their learning materials. However, LLMs also introduce new implications for academic integrity, curriculum design, and software engineering careers. This workshop will demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs to help attendees evaluate whether and how LLMs might be integrated into their pedagogy and research. We will also engage attendees in brainstorming to consider how LLMs will impact our field.

                  The Brazilian test has been extremely popular while prompting significant debate. The main source of controversy is rooted in its indirect nature; the material tensile strength is inferred upon assuming that cracking initiates at the centre of the sample. Here, we use the Griffith criterion and finite element analysis to map the conditions (jaws geometry and material properties) that result in the nucleation of a centre crack. Unlike previous studies, we do not restrict ourselves to evaluating the stress state at the disk centre; the failure envelope of the generalised Griffith criterion is used to establish the crack nucleation location. We find that the range of conditions where the Brazilian test is valid is much narrower than previously assumed, with current practices and standards being inappropriate for a wide range of rock-like materials. The results obtained are used to develop a protocol that experimentalists can follow to obtain a valid estimate of the material tensile strength. This is showcased with specific case studies and examples of valid and invalid tests from the literature. Furthermore, the uptake of this protocol is facilitated by providing a MATLAB App that determines the validity of the experiment for arbitrary test conditions.

                  The amplitude damping time, $T_1$, has long stood as the major factor limiting quantum fidelity in superconducting circuits, prompting concerted efforts in the material science and design of qubits aimed at increasing $T_1$. In contrast, the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, can usually be extended above $T_1$ (via, e.g., dynamical decoupling), to the point where it does not limit fidelity. In this article we propose a scheme for overcoming the conventional $T_1$ limit on fidelity by designing qubits in a way that amplitude damping errors can be detected and converted into erasure errors. Compared to standard qubit implementations our scheme improves the performance of fault-tolerant protocols, as numerically demonstrated by the circuit-noise simulations of the surface code. We describe two simple qubit implementations with superconducting circuits and discuss procedures for detecting amplitude damping errors, performing entangling gates, and extending $T_\phi$. Our results suggest that engineering efforts should focus on improving $T_\phi$ and the quality of quantum coherent control, as they effectively become the limiting factor on the performance of fault-tolerant protocols.
