                  Mathematical inequalities, combined with atomic-physics sum rules, enable one to derive lower and upper bounds for the Rosseland and/or Planck mean opacities. The resulting constraints must be satisfied, either for pure elements or mixtures. The intriguing law of anomalous numbers, also named Benford's law, is of great interest to detect errors in line-strength collections required for fine-structure calculations. Testing regularities may reveal hidden properties, such as the fractal nature of complex atomic spectra. The aforementioned constraints can also be useful to assess the reliability of experimental measurements. Finally, we recall that it is important to quantify the uncertainties due to interpolations in density-temperature opacity (or more generally atomic-data) tables, and that convergence studies are of course unavoidable in order to address the issue of completeness in terms of levels, configurations or superconfigurations, which is a cornerstone of opacity calculations.

                  Accurate 3D human pose estimation is essential for sports analytics, coaching, and injury prevention. However, existing datasets for monocular pose estimation do not adequately capture the challenging and dynamic nature of sports movements. In response, we introduce SportsPose, a large-scale 3D human pose dataset consisting of highly dynamic sports movements. With more than 176,000 3D poses from 24 different subjects performing 5 different sports activities, SportsPose provides a diverse and comprehensive set of 3D poses that reflect the complex and dynamic nature of sports movements. Contrary to other markerless datasets we have quantitatively evaluated the precision of SportsPose by comparing our poses with a commercial marker-based system and achieve a mean error of 34.5 mm across all evaluation sequences. This is comparable to the error reported on the commonly used 3DPW dataset. We further introduce a new metric, local movement, which describes the movement of the wrist and ankle joints in relation to the body. With this, we show that SportsPose contains more movement than the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets in these extremum joints, indicating that our movements are more dynamic. The dataset with accompanying code can be downloaded from our website. We hope that SportsPose will allow researchers and practitioners to develop and evaluate more effective models for the analysis of sports performance and injury prevention. With its realistic and diverse dataset, SportsPose provides a valuable resource for advancing the state-of-the-art in pose estimation in sports.

                  Relation extraction is a central task in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) research. We argue that an important type of relation not explored in NLP or IR research to date is that of an event being an argument - required or optional - of another event. We introduce the human-annotated Event Dependency Relation dataset (EDeR) which provides this dependency relation. The annotation is done on a sample of documents from the OntoNotes dataset, which has the added benefit that it integrates with existing, orthogonal, annotations of this dataset. We investigate baseline approaches for predicting the event dependency relation, the best of which achieves an accuracy of 82.61 for binary argument/non-argument classification. We show that recognizing this relation leads to more accurate event extraction (semantic role labelling) and can improve downstream tasks that depend on this, such as co-reference resolution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that predicting the three-way classification into the required argument, optional argument or non-argument is a more challenging task.

                  Current research on hate speech analysis is typically oriented towards monolingual and single classification tasks. In this paper, we present a new multilingual hate speech analysis dataset for English, Hindi, Arabic, French, German and Spanish languages for multiple domains across hate speech - Abuse, Racism, Sexism, Religious Hate and Extremism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of identifying various types of hate speech in these five wide domains in these six languages. In this work, we describe how we created the dataset, created annotations at high level and low level for different domains and how we use it to test the current state-of-the-art multilingual and multitask learning approaches. We evaluate our dataset in various monolingual, cross-lingual and machine translation classification settings and compare it against open source English datasets that we aggregated and merged for this task. Then we discuss how this approach can be used to create large scale hate-speech datasets and how to leverage our annotations in order to improve hate speech detection and classification in general.

                  This paper presents a dataset of agricultural pest images captured over five years by thousands of small holder farmers and farming extension workers across India. The dataset has been used to support a mobile application that relies on artificial intelligence to assist farmers with pest management decisions. Creation came from a mix of organized data collection, and from mobile application usage that was less controlled. This makes the dataset unique within the pest detection community, exhibiting a number of characteristics that place it closer to other non-agricultural objected detection datasets. This not only makes the dataset applicable to future pest management applications, it opens the door for a wide variety of other research agendas.

                  We study human pose estimation in extremely low-light images. This task is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting real low-light images with accurate labels, and severely corrupted inputs that degrade prediction quality significantly. To address the first issue, we develop a dedicated camera system and build a new dataset of real low-light images with accurate pose labels. Thanks to our camera system, each low-light image in our dataset is coupled with an aligned well-lit image, which enables accurate pose labeling and is used as privileged information during training. We also propose a new model and a new training strategy that fully exploit the privileged information to learn representation insensitive to lighting conditions. Our method demonstrates outstanding performance on real extremely low light images, and extensive analyses validate that both of our model and dataset contribute to the success.

                  Instrument playing technique (IPT) is a key element of musical presentation. However, most of the existing works for IPT detection only concern monophonic music signals, yet little has been done to detect IPTs in polyphonic instrumental solo pieces with overlapping IPTs or mixed IPTs. In this paper, we formulate it as a frame-level multi-label classification problem and apply it to Guzheng, a Chinese plucked string instrument. We create a new dataset, Guzheng\_Tech99, containing Guzheng recordings and onset, offset, pitch, IPT annotations of each note. Because different IPTs vary a lot in their lengths, we propose a new method to solve this problem using multi-scale network and self-attention. The multi-scale network extracts features from different scales, and the self-attention mechanism applied to the feature maps at the coarsest scale further enhances the long-range feature extraction. Our approach outperforms existing works by a large margin, indicating its effectiveness in IPT detection.

                  Machine learning algorithms, especially Neural Networks (NNs), are a valuable tool used to approximate non-linear relationships, like the AC-Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF), with considerable accuracy -- and achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude when deployed for use. Often in power systems literature, the NNs are trained with a fixed dataset generated prior to the training process. In this paper, we show that adapting the NN training dataset during training can improve the NN performance and substantially reduce its worst-case violations. This paper proposes an algorithm that identifies and enriches the training dataset with critical datapoints that reduce the worst-case violations and deliver a neural network with improved worst-case performance guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in four test power systems, ranging from 39-buses to 162-buses.

                  Recent work on database application development platforms has sought to include a declarative formulation of a conceptual data model in the application code, using annotations or attributes. Some recent work has used metadata to include the details of such formulations in the physical database, and this approach brings significant advantages in that the model can be enforced across a range of applications for a single database. In previous work, we have discussed the advantages for enterprise integration of typed graph data models (TGM), which can play a similar role in graphical databases, leveraging the existing support for the unified modelling language UML. Ideally, the integration of systems designed with different models, for example, graphical and relational database, should also be supported. In this work, we implement this approach, using metadata in a relational database management system (DBMS).

                  The goal of data-free meta-learning is to learn useful prior knowledge from a collection of pre-trained models without accessing their training data. However, existing works only solve the problem in parameter space, which (i) ignore the fruitful data knowledge contained in the pre-trained models; (ii) can not scale to large-scale pre-trained models; (iii) can only meta-learn pre-trained models with the same network architecture. To address those issues, we propose a unified framework, dubbed PURER, which contains: (1) ePisode cUrriculum inveRsion (ECI) during data-free meta training; and (2) invErsion calibRation following inner loop (ICFIL) during meta testing. During meta training, we propose ECI to perform pseudo episode training for learning to adapt fast to new unseen tasks. Specifically, we progressively synthesize a sequence of pseudo episodes by distilling the training data from each pre-trained model. The ECI adaptively increases the difficulty level of pseudo episodes according to the real-time feedback of the meta model. We formulate the optimization process of meta training with ECI as an adversarial form in an end-to-end manner. During meta testing, we further propose a simple plug-and-play supplement-ICFIL-only used during meta testing to narrow the gap between meta training and meta testing task distribution. Extensive experiments in various real-world scenarios show the superior performance of ours.

                  Recently, many video enhancement methods have been proposed to improve video quality from different aspects such as color, brightness, contrast, and stability. Therefore, how to evaluate the quality of the enhanced video in a way consistent with human visual perception is an important research topic. However, most video quality assessment methods mainly calculate video quality by estimating the distortion degrees of videos from an overall perspective. Few researchers have specifically proposed a video quality assessment method for video enhancement, and there is also no comprehensive video quality assessment dataset available in public. Therefore, we construct a Video quality assessment dataset for Perceptual Video Enhancement (VDPVE) in this paper. The VDPVE has 1211 videos with different enhancements, which can be divided into three sub-datasets: the first sub-dataset has 600 videos with color, brightness, and contrast enhancements; the second sub-dataset has 310 videos with deblurring; and the third sub-dataset has 301 deshaked videos. We invited 21 subjects (20 valid subjects) to rate all enhanced videos in the VDPVE. After normalizing and averaging the subjective opinion scores, the mean opinion score of each video can be obtained. Furthermore, we split the VDPVE into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, and verify the performance of several state-of-the-art video quality assessment methods on the test set of the VDPVE.

                  This article describes F-IVM, a unified approach for maintaining analytics over changing relational data. We exemplify its versatility in four disciplines: processing queries with group-by aggregates and joins; learning linear regression models using the covariance matrix of the input features; building Chow-Liu trees using pairwise mutual information of the input features; and matrix chain multiplication.   F-IVM has three main ingredients: higher-order incremental view maintenance; factorized computation; and ring abstraction. F-IVM reduces the maintenance of a task to that of a hierarchy of simple views. Such views are functions mapping keys, which are tuples of input values, to payloads, which are elements from a ring. F-IVM also supports efficient factorized computation over keys, payloads, and updates. Finally, F-IVM treats uniformly seemingly disparate tasks. In the key space, all tasks require joins and variable marginalization. In the payload space, tasks differ in the definition of the sum and product ring operations.   We implemented F-IVM on top of DBToaster and show that it can outperform classical first-order and fully recursive higher-order incremental view maintenance by orders of magnitude while using less memory.

                  A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), Studio.ai, and YouChat. Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.

                  Extraction of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and their semantic relations from unstructured text (e.g., Stack Overflow) is a fundamental work for software engineering tasks (e.g., API recommendation). However, existing approaches are rule-based and sequence-labeling based. They must manually enumerate the rules or label data for a wide range of sentence patterns, which involves a significant amount of labor overhead and is exacerbated by morphological and common-word ambiguity. In contrast to matching or labeling API entities and relations, this paper formulates heterogeneous API extraction and API relation extraction task as a sequence-to-sequence generation task, and proposes AERJE, an API entity-relation joint extraction model based on the large pre-trained language model. After training on a small number of ambiguous but correctly labeled data, AERJE builds a multi-task architecture that extracts API entities and relations from unstructured text using dynamic prompts. We systematically evaluate AERJE on a set of long and ambiguous sentences from Stack Overflow. The experimental results show that AERJE achieves high accuracy and discrimination ability in API entity-relation joint extraction, even with zero or few-shot fine-tuning.

                  Human activity recognition (HAR) aims to classify sensory time series into different activities, with wide applications in activity tracking, healthcare, human computer interaction, etc. Existing HAR works improve recognition performance by designing more complicated feature extraction methods, but they neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g., "open door" and "open fridge", "walk upstairs" and "walk downstairs". Through some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning activities into learning shared tokens ("open", "walk"), which is easier than learning the joint distribution ("open fridge", "walk upstairs") and helps transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated method, using OpenAI's ChatGPT, to generate shared actions and objects. Extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. We also show better performance in the long-tail activity distribution settings and few-shot settings.

                  Nearly all jurisdictions in the United States require a professional license exam, commonly referred to as "the Bar Exam," as a precondition for law practice. To even sit for the exam, most jurisdictions require that an applicant completes at least seven years of post-secondary education, including three years at an accredited law school. In addition, most test-takers also undergo weeks to months of further, exam-specific preparation. Despite this significant investment of time and capital, approximately one in five test-takers still score under the rate required to pass the exam on their first try. In the face of a complex task that requires such depth of knowledge, what, then, should we expect of the state of the art in "AI?" In this research, we document our experimental evaluation of the performance of OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` model, often-referred to as GPT-3.5, on the multistate multiple choice (MBE) section of the exam. While we find no benefit in fine-tuning over GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance at the scale of our training data, we do find that hyperparameter optimization and prompt engineering positively impacted GPT-3.5's zero-shot performance. For best prompt and parameters, GPT-3.5 achieves a headline correct rate of 50.3% on a complete NCBE MBE practice exam, significantly in excess of the 25% baseline guessing rate, and performs at a passing rate for both Evidence and Torts. GPT-3.5's ranking of responses is also highly-correlated with correctness; its top two and top three choices are correct 71% and 88% of the time, respectively, indicating very strong non-entailment performance. While our ability to interpret these results is limited by nascent scientific understanding of LLMs and the proprietary nature of GPT, we believe that these results strongly suggest that an LLM will pass the MBE component of the Bar Exam in the near future.

                  Despite a generally accepted framework for describing the Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) afterglows, the nature of the compact object at the central engine and the mechanism behind the prompt emission remain debated. The striped jet model is a promising venue to connect the various GRB stages since it gives a robust prediction for the relation of jet bulk acceleration, magnetization and dissipation profile as a function of distance. Here, we use the constraints of the magnetization and bulk Lorentz of the jet flow at the large scales where the jet starts interacting with the ambient gas in a large sample of bursts to (i) test the striped jet model for the GRB flow and (ii) study its predictions for the prompt emission and the constraints on the nature of the central engine. We find that the peak of the photospheric component of the emission predicted by the model is in agreement with the observed prompt emission spectra in the majority of the bursts in our sample, with a radiative efficiency of about 10 per cent. Furthermore, we adopt two different approaches to correlate the peak energies of the bursts with the type of central engine to find that more bursts are compatible with a neutron star central engine compared to a black hole one. Lastly, we conclude that the model favors broader distribution of stripe length-scales which results in a more gradual dissipation profile in comparison to the case where the jet stripes are characterized by a single length-scale.

                  Recent methods demonstrate that data augmentation using counterfactual knowledge can teach models the causal structure of a task, leading to robust and generalizable models. However, such counterfactual data often has a limited scale and diversity if crowdsourced and is computationally expensive to extend to new perturbation types if generated using supervised methods. To address this, we introduce a new framework called DISCO for automatically generating high-quality counterfactual data at scale. DISCO engineers prompts to generate phrasal perturbations with a large general language model. Then, a task-specific teacher model filters the generation to distill high-quality counterfactual data. We show that learning with this counterfactual data yields a comparatively small student model that is 6% (absolute) more robust and generalizes 5% better across distributions than baselines on various challenging evaluations. This model is also 15% more sensitive in differentiating original and counterfactual examples, on three evaluation sets written by human workers and via human-AI collaboration.

                  The physical mechanism of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains elusive. One of the difficulties in nailing down their physical mechanism comes from the fact that there has been no clear observational evidence on how far from the central engine the prompt gamma-rays of GRBs are emitted while the competing physical mechanisms predict different characteristic distances. Here we present a simple study addressing this question by making use of the "high-latitude emission" (HLE). We show that our detailed numerical modeling exhibits a clear signature of HLE in the decaying phase of "broad pulses" of GRBs. We show that the HLE can emerge as a prominent spectral break in $F_{\nu}$ spectra and dominate the peak of $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectra even while the "line-of-sight emission" (LoSE) is still ongoing, hence providing a new view of HLE emergence. We remark that this "HLE break" could be hidden in some broad pulses, depending on the proximity between the peak energies of the LoSE and the HLE. Also, we present three examples of Fermi-GBM GRBs with broad pulses that exhibit the HLE signature. We show that their gamma-ray emitting region should be located at $\sim 10^{16}$ cm from the central engine, which disfavors the photosphere models and small-radii internal shock models but favors magnetic dissipation models with a large emission radius.

                  Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and Codex, now enable software developers to generate code based on a natural language prompt. Within computer science education, researchers are exploring the potential for LLMs to generate code explanations and programming assignments using carefully crafted prompts. These advances may enable students to interact with code in new ways while helping instructors scale their learning materials. However, LLMs also introduce new implications for academic integrity, curriculum design, and software engineering careers. This workshop will demonstrate the capabilities of LLMs to help attendees evaluate whether and how LLMs might be integrated into their pedagogy and research. We will also engage attendees in brainstorming to consider how LLMs will impact our field.

                Griffith-based analysis of crack initiation location in a Brazilian test

                  The Brazilian test has been extremely popular while prompting significant debate. The main source of controversy is rooted in its indirect nature; the material tensile strength is inferred upon assuming that cracking initiates at the centre of the sample. Here, we use the Griffith criterion and finite element analysis to map the conditions (jaws geometry and material properties) that result in the nucleation of a centre crack. Unlike previous studies, we do not restrict ourselves to evaluating the stress state at the disk centre; the failure envelope of the generalised Griffith criterion is used to establish the crack nucleation location. We find that the range of conditions where the Brazilian test is valid is much narrower than previously assumed, with current practices and standards being inappropriate for a wide range of rock-like materials. The results obtained are used to develop a protocol that experimentalists can follow to obtain a valid estimate of the material tensile strength. This is showcased with specific case studies and examples of valid and invalid tests from the literature. Furthermore, the uptake of this protocol is facilitated by providing a MATLAB App that determines the validity of the experiment for arbitrary test conditions.

                Erasure qubits: Overcoming the $T_1$ limit in superconducting circuits

                  The amplitude damping time, $T_1$, has long stood as the major factor limiting quantum fidelity in superconducting circuits, prompting concerted efforts in the material science and design of qubits aimed at increasing $T_1$. In contrast, the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, can usually be extended above $T_1$ (via, e.g., dynamical decoupling), to the point where it does not limit fidelity. In this article we propose a scheme for overcoming the conventional $T_1$ limit on fidelity by designing qubits in a way that amplitude damping errors can be detected and converted into erasure errors. Compared to standard qubit implementations our scheme improves the performance of fault-tolerant protocols, as numerically demonstrated by the circuit-noise simulations of the surface code. We describe two simple qubit implementations with superconducting circuits and discuss procedures for detecting amplitude damping errors, performing entangling gates, and extending $T_\phi$. Our results suggest that engineering efforts should focus on improving $T_\phi$ and the quality of quantum coherent control, as they effectively become the limiting factor on the performance of fault-tolerant protocols.

                On LGRB progenitors: an approach from thermally-produced neutrinos

                  Gamma-ray bursts (GRB) are the most intense electromagnetic (EM) sources in the Universe. Long GRB (LGRB) correspond to those events with a typical prompt emission of more than a few seconds. It is generally assumed that they are originated after an implosion of a very massive star within a central compact object engine that can be either a black hole (BH) or a rapidly-spinning highly-magnetized neutron star (NS). Nevertheless, one of the most challenging aspects of defining a unique model is that the progenitor remains initially hidden for direct EM observation. In this work, we investigate the evolution of thermally-produced neutrino properties in both GRB progenitors to provide an alternative solution. We consider the characteristics of both progenitors and the fireball scenario to calculate the oscillation probabilities within a three-flavor admixture regime. Then we obtain the expected neutrino ratio and we also estimate the number of events from these sources that could be detected in the future Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) detector, considering a sample of previously observed GRB with remarkably signs of being magnetar-produced. Our findings indicate that examining the predicted neutrino rates result in an additional mechanism to determine the type of progenitor associated with these events. This is especially useful when, for instance, we cannot directly observe an electromagnetic counterpart, such as so-called "failed" GRB with hidden jets, or when light curve analysis is inconclusive.
