# Frontpage 

Your frontpage for the internet.
Frontpage is made by scraping arxiv and runnig a spaCy model that detects if the abstract describes a paper about a new specific topic. Right now we try to find interesting articles about new datasets or prompt engineering. Many datasets will be about NLP, but typically some computer vision, humanities and physics datasets are in the mix too.
