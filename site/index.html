                  We study human pose estimation in extremely low-light images. This task is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting real low-light images with accurate labels, and severely corrupted inputs that degrade prediction quality significantly. To address the first issue, we develop a dedicated camera system and build a new dataset of real low-light images with accurate pose labels. Thanks to our camera system, each low-light image in our dataset is coupled with an aligned well-lit image, which enables accurate pose labeling and is used as privileged information during training. We also propose a new model and a new training strategy that fully exploit the privileged information to learn representation insensitive to lighting conditions. Our method demonstrates outstanding performance on real extremely low light images, and extensive analyses validate that both of our model and dataset contribute to the success.

                  Instrument playing technique (IPT) is a key element of musical presentation. However, most of the existing works for IPT detection only concern monophonic music signals, yet little has been done to detect IPTs in polyphonic instrumental solo pieces with overlapping IPTs or mixed IPTs. In this paper, we formulate it as a frame-level multi-label classification problem and apply it to Guzheng, a Chinese plucked string instrument. We create a new dataset, Guzheng\_Tech99, containing Guzheng recordings and onset, offset, pitch, IPT annotations of each note. Because different IPTs vary a lot in their lengths, we propose a new method to solve this problem using multi-scale network and self-attention. The multi-scale network extracts features from different scales, and the self-attention mechanism applied to the feature maps at the coarsest scale further enhances the long-range feature extraction. Our approach outperforms existing works by a large margin, indicating its effectiveness in IPT detection.

                  Machine learning algorithms, especially Neural Networks (NNs), are a valuable tool used to approximate non-linear relationships, like the AC-Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF), with considerable accuracy -- and achieving a speedup of several orders of magnitude when deployed for use. Often in power systems literature, the NNs are trained with a fixed dataset generated prior to the training process. In this paper, we show that adapting the NN training dataset during training can improve the NN performance and substantially reduce its worst-case violations. This paper proposes an algorithm that identifies and enriches the training dataset with critical datapoints that reduce the worst-case violations and deliver a neural network with improved worst-case performance guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm in four test power systems, ranging from 39-buses to 162-buses.

                  Recent work on database application development platforms has sought to include a declarative formulation of a conceptual data model in the application code, using annotations or attributes. Some recent work has used metadata to include the details of such formulations in the physical database, and this approach brings significant advantages in that the model can be enforced across a range of applications for a single database. In previous work, we have discussed the advantages for enterprise integration of typed graph data models (TGM), which can play a similar role in graphical databases, leveraging the existing support for the unified modelling language UML. Ideally, the integration of systems designed with different models, for example, graphical and relational database, should also be supported. In this work, we implement this approach, using metadata in a relational database management system (DBMS).

                  We present SLOPER4D, a novel scene-aware dataset collected in large urban environments to facilitate the research of global human pose estimation (GHPE) with human-scene interaction in the wild. Employing a head-mounted device integrated with a LiDAR and camera, we record 12 human subjects' activities over 10 diverse urban scenes from an egocentric view. Frame-wise annotations for 2D key points, 3D pose parameters, and global translations are provided, together with reconstructed scene point clouds. To obtain accurate 3D ground truth in such large dynamic scenes, we propose a joint optimization method to fit local SMPL meshes to the scene and fine-tune the camera calibration during dynamic motions frame by frame, resulting in plausible and scene-natural 3D human poses. Eventually, SLOPER4D consists of 15 sequences of human motions, each of which has a trajectory length of more than 200 meters (up to 1,300 meters) and covers an area of more than 2,000 $m^2$ (up to 13,000 $m^2$), including more than 100K LiDAR frames, 300k video frames, and 500K IMU-based motion frames. With SLOPER4D, we provide a detailed and thorough analysis of two critical tasks, including camera-based 3D HPE and LiDAR-based 3D HPE in urban environments, and benchmark a new task, GHPE. The in-depth analysis demonstrates SLOPER4D poses significant challenges to existing methods and produces great research opportunities.

                  The QM9 dataset [Scientific Data, Vol. 1, 140022 (2014)] became a standard dataset to benchmark machine learning methods, especially on molecular graphs. It contains geometries as well as multiple computed molecular properties of 133,885 compounds at B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory, including frontier orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) energies. However, the accuracy of HOMO/LUMO predictions from density functional theory, including hybrid methods such as B3LYP, is limited for many applications. In contrast, the GW method significantly improves HOMO/LUMO prediction accuracy, with mean unsigned errors in the GW100 benchmark dataset of 100 meV. In this work, we present a new dataset of HOMO/LUMO energies for the QM9 compounds, computed using the GW method. This database may serve as a benchmark of HOMO/LUMO prediction, delta-learning, and transfer learning, particularly for larger molecules where GW is the most accurate but still numerically feasible method. We expect this dataset to enable the development of more accurate machine learning models for predicting molecular properties

TURB-Lagr data are influenced by the strong non-Gaussian fluctuations characteristic of turbulence and by the rough and non differentiable fields.

                  Event cameras provide high temporal precision, low data rates, and high dynamic range visual perception, which are well-suited for optical flow estimation. While data-driven optical flow estimation has obtained great success in RGB cameras, its generalization performance is seriously hindered in event cameras mainly due to the limited and biased training data. In this paper, we present a novel simulator, BlinkSim, for the fast generation of large-scale data for event-based optical flow. BlinkSim consists of a configurable rendering engine and a flexible engine for event data simulation. By leveraging the wealth of current 3D assets, the rendering engine enables us to automatically build up thousands of scenes with different objects, textures, and motion patterns and render very high-frequency images for realistic event data simulation. Based on BlinkSim, we construct a large training dataset and evaluation benchmark BlinkFlow that contains sufficient, diversiform, and challenging event data with optical flow ground truth. Experiments show that BlinkFlow improves the generalization performance of state-of-the-art methods by more than 40% on average and up to 90%. Moreover, we further propose an Event optical Flow transFormer (E-FlowFormer) architecture. Powered by our BlinkFlow, E-FlowFormer outperforms the SOTA methods by up to 91% on MVSEC dataset and 14% on DSEC dataset and presents the best generalization performance.

                  We present a new AI task and baseline solution for Inter-Subjective Reasoning. We define inter-subjective information, to be a mixture of objective and subjective information possibly shared by different parties. Examples may include commodities and their objective properties as reported by IR (Information Retrieval) systems, that need to be cross-referenced with subjective user reviews from an online forum. For an AI system to successfully reason about both, it needs to be able to combine symbolic reasoning of objective facts with the shared consensus found on subjective user reviews. To this end we introduce the NeuroQL dataset and DSL (Domain-specific Language) as a baseline solution for this problem. NeuroQL is a neuro-symbolic language that extends logical unification with neural primitives for extraction and retrieval. It can function as a target for automatic translation of inter-subjective questions (posed in natural language) into the neuro-symbolic code that can answer them.

                  Current Active Speaker Detection (ASD) models achieve great results on AVA-ActiveSpeaker (AVA), using only sound and facial features. Although this approach is applicable in movie setups (AVA), it is not suited for less constrained conditions. To demonstrate this limitation, we propose a Wilder Active Speaker Detection (WASD) dataset, with increased difficulty by targeting the two key components of current ASD: audio and face. Grouped into 5 categories, ranging from optimal conditions to surveillance settings, WASD contains incremental challenges for ASD with tactical impairment of audio and face data. We select state-of-the-art models and assess their performance in two groups of WASD: Easy (cooperative settings) and Hard (audio and/or face are specifically degraded). The results show that: 1) AVA trained models maintain a state-of-the-art performance in WASD Easy group, while underperforming in the Hard one, showing the 2) similarity between AVA and Easy data; and 3) training in WASD does not improve models performance to AVA levels, particularly for audio impairment and surveillance settings. This shows that AVA does not prepare models for wild ASD and current approaches are subpar to deal with such conditions. The proposed dataset also contains body data annotations to provide a new source for ASD, and is available at https://github.com/Tiago-Roxo/WASD.

                  Defect prediction has been a popular research topic where machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have found numerous applications. However, these ML/DL-based defect prediction models are often limited by the quality and size of their datasets. In this paper, we present Defectors, a large dataset for just-in-time and line-level defect prediction. Defectors consists of $\approx$ 213K source code files ($\approx$ 93K defective and $\approx$ 120K defect-free) that span across 24 popular Python projects. These projects come from 18 different domains, including machine learning, automation, and internet-of-things. Such a scale and diversity make Defectors a suitable dataset for training ML/DL models, especially transformer models that require large and diverse datasets. We also foresee several application areas of our dataset including defect prediction and defect explanation.   Dataset link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7708984

                  Distribution shifts are a major source of failure of deployed machine learning models. However, evaluating a model's reliability under distribution shifts can be challenging, especially since it may be difficult to acquire counterfactual examples that exhibit a specified shift. In this work, we introduce dataset interfaces: a framework which allows users to scalably synthesize such counterfactual examples from a given dataset. Specifically, we represent each class from the input dataset as a custom token within the text space of a text-to-image diffusion model. By incorporating these tokens into natural language prompts, we can then generate instantiations of objects in that dataset under desired distribution shifts. We demonstrate how applying our framework to the ImageNet dataset enables us to study model behavior across a diverse array of shifts, including variations in background, lighting, and attributes of the objects themselves.

                  For downstream applications of vision-language pre-trained models, there has been significant interest in constructing effective prompts. Existing works on prompt engineering, which either require laborious manual designs or optimize the prompt tuning as a point estimation problem, may fail to describe diverse characteristics of categories and limit their applications. We introduce a Bayesian probabilistic resolution to prompt learning, where the label-specific stochastic prompts are generated hierarchically by first sampling a latent vector from an underlying distribution and then employing a lightweight generative model. Importantly, we semantically regularize prompt learning with the visual knowledge and view images and the corresponding prompts as patch and token sets under optimal transport, which pushes the prompt tokens to faithfully capture the label-specific visual concepts, instead of overfitting the training categories. Moreover, the proposed model can also be straightforwardly extended to the conditional case where the instance-conditional prompts are generated to improve the generalizability. Extensive experiments on 15 datasets show promising transferability and generalization performance of our proposed model.

                  This case study investigates the task of job classification in a real-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether an English-language job posting is appropriate for a graduate or entry-level position. We explore multiple approaches to text classification, including supervised approaches such as traditional models like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and state-of-the-art deep learning methods such as DeBERTa. We compare them with Large Language Models (LLMs) used in both few-shot and zero-shot classification settings. To accomplish this task, we employ prompt engineering, a technique that involves designing prompts to guide the LLMs towards the desired output. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of two commercially available state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-based language models, text-davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo. We also conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of different aspects of prompt engineering on the model's performance. Our results show that, with a well-designed prompt, a zero-shot gpt-3.5-turbo classifier outperforms all other models, achieving a 6% increase in Precision@95% Recall compared to the best supervised approach. Furthermore, we observe that the wording of the prompt is a critical factor in eliciting the appropriate "reasoning" in the model, and that seemingly minor aspects of the prompt significantly affect the model's performance.

                  The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly conversational LLMs like ChatGPT, have prompted changes in a range of fields, including design. This study aims to examine the capabilities of ChatGPT in a human-centered design process. To this end, a hypothetical design project was conducted, where ChatGPT was utilized to generate personas, simulate interviews with fictional users, create new design ideas, simulate usage scenarios and conversations between an imaginary prototype and fictional users, and lastly evaluate user experience. The results show that ChatGPT effectively performed the tasks assigned to it as a designer, user, or product, providing mostly appropriate responses. The study does, however, highlight some drawbacks such as forgotten information, partial responses, and a lack of output diversity. The paper explains the potential benefits and limitations of using conversational LLMs in design, discusses its implications, and suggests directions for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

                  Logs generated by large-scale software systems provide crucial information for engineers to understand the system status and diagnose problems of the systems. Log parsing, which converts raw log messages into structured data, is the first step to enabling automated log analytics. Existing log parsers extract the common part as log templates using statistical features. However, these log parsers often fail to identify the correct templates and parameters because: 1) they often overlook the semantic meaning of log messages, and 2) they require domain-specific knowledge for different log datasets. To address the limitations of existing methods, in this paper, we propose LogPPT to capture the patterns of templates using prompt-based few-shot learning. LogPPT utilises a novel prompt tuning method to recognise keywords and parameters based on a few labelled log data. In addition, an adaptive random sampling algorithm is designed to select a small yet diverse training set. We have conducted extensive experiments on 16 public log datasets. The experimental results show that LogPPT is effective and efficient for log parsing.

                  Text-to-image generative models have recently exploded in popularity and accessibility. Yet so far, use of these models in creative tasks that bridge the 2D digital world and the creation of physical artefacts has been understudied. We conduct a pilot study to investigate if and how text-to-image models can be used to assist in upstream tasks within the creative process, such as ideation and visualization, prior to a sculpture-making activity. Thirty participants selected sculpture-making materials and generated three images using the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator, each with text prompts of their choice, with the aim of informing and then creating a physical sculpture. The majority of participants (23/30) reported that the generated images informed their sculptures, and 28/30 reported interest in using text-to-image models to help them in a creative task in the future. We identify several prompt engineering strategies and find that a participant's prompting strategy relates to their stage in the creative process. We discuss how our findings can inform support for users at different stages of the design process and for using text-to-image models for physical artefact design.

                  Explaining the black-box predictions of NLP models naturally and accurately is an important open problem in natural language generation. These free-text explanations are expected to contain sufficient and carefully-selected evidence to form supportive arguments for predictions. Due to the superior generative capacity of large pretrained language models, recent work built on prompt engineering enables explanation generation without specific training. However, explanation generated through single-pass prompting often lacks sufficiency and conciseness. To address this problem, we develop an information bottleneck method EIB to produce refined explanations that are sufficient and concise. Our approach regenerates the free-text explanation by polishing the single-pass output from the pretrained language model but retaining the information that supports the contents being explained. Experiments on two out-of-domain tasks verify the effectiveness of EIB through automatic evaluation and thoroughly-conducted human evaluation.

                  Automated GUI testing is widely used to help ensure the quality of mobile apps. However, many GUIs require appropriate text inputs to proceed to the next page which remains a prominent obstacle for testing coverage. Considering the diversity and semantic requirement of valid inputs (e.g., flight departure, movie name), it is challenging to automate the text input generation. Inspired by the fact that the pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) has made outstanding progress in text generation, we propose an approach named QTypist based on LLM for intelligently generating semantic input text according to the GUI context. To boost the performance of LLM in the mobile testing scenario, we develop a prompt-based data construction and tuning method which automatically extracts the prompts and answers for model tuning. We evaluate QTypist on 106 apps from Google Play and the result shows that the passing rate of QTypist is 87%, which is 93% higher than the best baseline. We also integrate QTypist with the automated GUI testing tools and it can cover 42% more app activities, 52% more pages, and subsequently help reveal 122% more bugs compared with the raw tool.

                Multi-messenger model for the prompt emission from GRB 221009A

                  We present a multi-messenger model for the prompt emission from GRB 221009A within the internal shock scenario. We consider the time-dependent evolution of the outflow with its impact on the observed light curve from multiple collisions, and the self-consistent generation of the electromagnetic spectrum in synchrotron and inverse Compton-dominated scenarios. Our leptohadronic model includes UHE protons potentially accelerated in the outflow, and their feedback on spectral energy distribution and on the neutrino emission. We find that we can roughly reproduce the observed light curves with an engine with varying ejection velocity of ultra-relativistic material, which has an intermediate quiescent period of about 200 seconds and a variability timescale of $\sim1$~s. We consider baryonic loadings of 3 and 30 that are compatible with the hypothesis that the highest-energetic LHAASO photons might come from UHECR interactions with the extragalactic background light, and the paradigm that energetic GRBs may power the UHECR flux. For these values and the high dissipation radii considered we find consistency with the non-observation of neutrinos and no significant signatures on the electromagnetic spectrum. Inverse Compton-dominated scenarios from the prompt emission are demonstrated to lead to about an order of magnitude higher fluxes in the HE-range; this enhancement is testable by its spectral impact in the Fermi-GBM and LAT ranges.
